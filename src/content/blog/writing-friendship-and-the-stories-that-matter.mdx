!\[video]\([https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XOHdmG4aheE](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XOHdmG4aheE)) Harry Hayman has been developing scripts for various films over the past several years. For him, writing is a process that requires patience, focus, and the right mindset. “These things take time,” he explains. “You want to get it right, you want to be in the right place mentally. You want to have the right idea, the right story.”

His work often draws inspiration from real-life experiences and the people closest to him. Harry talks about his circle of fourteen close friends, whom he stays connected with through regular messages and annual trips. These friendships serve as a foundation for his storytelling. “We can tell everybody’s story, with their permission, of course,” he says. He has even considered incorporating his friends into his projects, using them as actors to bring authenticity and life to his films.

Harry reflects on the value of these friendships, noting how the experiences shared with close friends often provide richer material than chasing flashy or adventurous experiences. “These guys are all that matters. When I was younger, I wanted to run off to Vegas or Chicago or Louisville for the Derby. But nothing matters more than getting together with the old chums,” he says. For him, the moments with friends offer emotional depth and context that enrich his scripts.

Many of Harry’s projects are rooted in Philadelphia. “All the stories are based in Philadelphia, and all the stories have a charity associated with them,” he explains. For Harry, storytelling is never just about entertainment; it’s also about community, giving back, and creating narratives that matter on a personal and societal level.

Working on multiple scripts simultaneously, Harry navigates the challenge of maintaining compelling storylines while keeping each story relevant and authentic. His approach combines reflection, observation, and an emphasis on relationships, community, and real-world experiences.

Through this ongoing process, Harry Hayman demonstrates that great storytelling takes time and intention. Every film he works on seeks to capture the essence of human connection, the bonds of friendship, and the character of Philadelphia itself. His scripts aim to resonate emotionally, highlight meaningful relationships, and remind audiences that the stories worth telling often come from the people and experiences closest to us.
