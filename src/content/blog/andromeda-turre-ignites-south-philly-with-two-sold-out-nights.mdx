When the lights dimmed at SOUTH Jazz Club this weekend, the air was already electric. Every seat was filled, every heart ready — and when Andromeda Turre stepped onto the stage, Philly knew it was in for something special.

The daughter of jazz legend Steve Turre, Andromeda didn’t just perform — she transported the audience. Her soulful vocals wove effortlessly through sounds of crystal bowls, vibraphone, and rich jazz textures that seemed to float through the room. It wasn’t just music. It was energy, connection, and pure artistry.

Backed by an incredible lineup, the night became a family affair in every sense of the word. Anthony DeCarlo set the tone with fiery guitar riffs, Richie Goods held the groove with his masterful bass lines, and Orion Turre — Andromeda’s brother — drove the rhythm with precision and power. Morgan Walbridge’s vibraphone shimmered like stars over the sound, while Chelsea Baratz brought the unmistakable pulse of Philly soul through her sax.

The crowd didn’t just listen — they *felt*. Goosebumps, cheers, and a standing ovation that lasted long after the final note. Both nights were completely sold out, and by the end, it was clear why.

Andromeda Turre’s performance wasn’t just about the music. It was a celebration of legacy, love, and the living spirit of jazz that continues to thrive in Philadelphia.

At SOUTH, that spirit is alive and well — and this weekend proved it once again.
