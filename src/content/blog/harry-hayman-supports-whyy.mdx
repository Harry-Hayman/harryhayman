Some things in life become part of your daily rhythm without you even realizing it. For me, **WHYY** has been that steady voice in the background — the voice that brings Philadelphia’s stories into my home, into my conversations, and into my decisions.  

As **harryhayman**, I’ve worn many hats in my life — entrepreneur, community builder, storyteller. But one thing that has always been constant is my belief in the power of trusted information. WHYY is more than a radio station or a TV channel. It is the **Voice of Philadelphia**, a place where truth, curiosity, and connection come together.

## Membership isn’t just support, it’s partnership

When I renewed my WHYY membership this year, it wasn’t just a transaction. It was a way of saying: *I believe in this*. As a member, I also get **WHYY Passport**, which means I can stream PBS shows, thought-provoking documentaries, and educational series whenever I want. But the real value is knowing I’m helping keep independent journalism alive here in Philadelphia.
