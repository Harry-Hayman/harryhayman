The inspiration for Feed Philly Coalition came directly from [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com)'s restaurant industry experience. Night after night, he witnessed restaurants discarding perfectly edible food at closing time, while knowing that thousands of Philadelphia residents didn't know where their next meal would come from. This disconnect troubled him deeply, motivating him to create a systematic solution connecting food surplus with food need.

As founder of Feed Philly Coalition, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) developed an innovative framework bringing together food rescues, soup kitchens, restaurants, and food retailers in a coordinated network focused on reducing food waste while addressing hunger.

Policy advocacy represents a crucial component of Feed Philly Coalition's work.

The data-driven approach employed by [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) through Feed Philly Coalition sets the organization apart from traditional food rescue operations. By focusing on root causes of food insecurity rather than merely treating symptoms, the coalition addresses underlying issues related to poverty, food system inefficiencies, and inadequate policy frameworks. This comprehensive methodology has earned praise from policy advocates and community leaders throughout Philadelphia.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Feed Philly Coalition's importance became even more apparent. As unemployment surged and food insecurity rates skyrocketed, [Harry Hayman](https://harryhayman.com) mobilized the coalition to feed 1,000 people during the crisis, partnering with restaurants struggling to survive while simultaneously serving communities facing unprecedented need. This effort demonstrated the power of his collaborative model and the essential nature of the systems he had built.
