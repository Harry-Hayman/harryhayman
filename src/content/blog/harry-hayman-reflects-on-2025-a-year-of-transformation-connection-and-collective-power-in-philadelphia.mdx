January 1, 2026

The calendar turned. The city exhaled. And here we are.

As Harry Hayman steps into 2026, the weight of 2025 still lingers in the best possible way. It was a year that reminded us what Philadelphia is capable of when people show up, roll up their sleeves, and refuse to accept things as they are. From food security battles to jazz nights that felt like church, from documentary filming to standing beside youth organizations building futures, 2025 was a year where intention met action and where community became the loudest answer to every challenge.

This blog is not a victory lap. It is a reflection. It is gratitude. And it is a reminder that the work never stops because the city we love never stops needing us.

## Feed Philly Coalition: When Policy Meets Purpose

The [Feed Philly Coalition](https://feedphillycoalition.org/) has always been about more than food rescue. It has been about systems change. And in 2025, Harry Hayman watched that vision take root in ways that felt both monumental and deeply personal.

The street interviews for the I AM HUNGRY documentary captured something raw. Philadelphians were tired of watching their neighbors struggle while policy cycles repeated without meaningful change. Students, seniors, workers, parents, and long time residents all expressed frustration, but they also expressed hope. They believe food insecurity is solvable. They want accountability. They want action.

That footage became a mirror. It showed a city with resilience, creativity, and heart. It also showed a community demanding transformation at the system level. The documentary is still in development, but every frame carries the weight of those voices. Harry Hayman and the team remain committed to documenting the truth and challenging Philadelphia to meet the moment.

Throughout 2025, the Feed Philly Coalition brought together more than 25 partner organizations, launched over 10 community awareness campaigns, and supported more than 5 policy initiatives aimed at creating lasting change. The work extended beyond simple food redistribution. It focused on policy advocacy, community education, and cross sector collaboration.

The coalition advocated for legislation that would reward restaurants for donating leftover food, recognizing that sustainable solutions require changing the economic and legal frameworks. During community health events, school conferences, and public forums, Harry Hayman spoke about hydroponics, disruption, and dignity. The message was clear. Food is not charity. Food is a right. And Philadelphia can build systems that reflect that truth.

The partnership with organizations like [Philly Food Works](https://phillyfoodworks.com/), local farmers, and innovative urban agriculture projects demonstrated that when money stays local, communities grow stronger. Every tomato, every mushroom, every head of garlic grown in the region keeps dollars circulating in Philadelphia, supports farmers, creates jobs, and strengthens the type of community focused economy that uplifts families and stabilizes neighborhoods.

## The Philadelphia Jazz Experience: Where Culture Becomes Connection

Jazz has always been Harry Hayman's language of love. It started behind the bar at Zanzibar Blue in the early 1990s. It grew through years of managing SOUTH Jazz Kitchen. And in 2025, the [Philadelphia Jazz Experience](https://philadelphiajazzexperience.org/) solidified its place as one of the city's most important cultural preservation organizations.

The mission statement says it all. Through inclusivity, collaboration, and the art of harmonizing diverse voices, the organization is dedicated to raising funds, distributing resources, and sparking genuine change. Jazz flourishes. Creativity thrives. And the city pulses to the rhythm of shared experiences.

Throughout 2025, the Philadelphia Jazz Experience hosted performances that felt like sacred rituals. Brandee Younger brought her harp fueled revolution to SOUTH for six sold out shows. Her performance was more than music. It was a spiritual recalibration. With her masterful trio, she transformed the stage into a protest, a map, and a weapon of beauty.

Lakecia Benjamin delivered a Coltrane tribute that felt like a sonic resurrection. It was more than a performance. It was a spiritual awakening set to saxophone. Allan Harris turned six sold out nights into soul, justice, and joy in perfect time. A voice that fights and heals. A band that feels like family. A room that reminded Philadelphia why live jazz still matters.

Jeff Bradshaw proved once again why there is no party like a Jeff Bradshaw party. The North Philly trombone legend commanded the room with joy, groove, precision, and soul. Andromeda Turre ignited SOUTH with two sold out nights that blended soulful vocals, crystal bowls, and stunning musicianship. Carol Riddick and Gerald Veasley set the room ablaze with a powerful fusion of soul, jazz, and Philly energy.

But the Philadelphia Jazz Experience was not just about performances. It was about education, preservation, and building pipelines for the next generation. Harry Hayman worked with schools, community centers, and cultural institutions to ensure that young people understood jazz as more than entertainment. Jazz is creativity. Jazz is collaboration. Jazz is improvisation. Skills that extend beyond music into everyday life.

The vision for a national multi day Philadelphia Jazz Festival continued to develop throughout 2025. Working with Sound Diplomacy and festival experts, Harry Hayman laid groundwork for an event that would elevate Philly's jazz heritage to national and international prominence. The conversations were strategic. The partnerships were forming. The momentum was building.

## SOUTH: Where Food, Jazz, and Community Collide

[SOUTH Restaurant & Jazz Club](https://southjazz.com/) remained the heartbeat of Harry Hayman's hospitality work in 2025. The restaurant operated at peak performance all year. Exceptional service. Food to die for. Perfectly crafted cocktails. World class jazz. An atmosphere that is second to none.

Every weekend brought legendary artists. Every night brought neighbors, visitors, and music lovers who understood that SOUTH was not just a venue. It was a cultural destination. A place where food, music, and community come together. A space where Southern hospitality meets Philadelphia soul.

The recognition from [Resy](https://resy.com/) and [WHYY](https://whyy.org/) throughout the year highlighted what locals already knew. SOUTH is firing on all cylinders. The team is proud of what they have built. The vision Harry Hayman carried from his early days at Zanzibar Blue and through his management years has manifested as something rare and essential.

## Gemini Hospitality Consultants: Mentoring the Next Generation

Through [Gemini Hospitality Consultants](https://geminiconsultantsphiladelphia.com/), Harry Hayman spent 2025 sharing over 30 years of hospitality wisdom with emerging restaurateurs and established operators navigating challenging times. The consulting work goes beyond simple business strategy. It helps clients understand community engagement, sustainable practices, and stakeholder capitalism.

The Philly Chef Conference in December, hosted by Drexel University and championed by Jon Deutsch, brought together some of the brightest minds in food. John Fry, Adam Rapoport, JJ Johnson, Kim Severson, Brady Williams, Erick Williams, Stefano Secchi, David Nayfield, Ahktar Nawab, Anthony Myint, Dana Cowin, Katie Button, Bo Bech, Antonio Bachour, Karen Akunowicz, Eric Adjepong, and so many more. Harry Hayman was right in the middle of the action, learning, connecting, and sharing the collaborative spirit that drives Philadelphia forward.

These moments matter. They represent the living proof that hospitality is about more than transactions. It is about creating spaces where the city's heartbeat becomes audible.

## Veggie Graffiti: Growing the Future

[Veggie Graffiti](https://veggiegraffiti.com/) and controlled environmental agriculture continued pushing boundaries in 2025. The initiative combines hydroponic technology with sustainable practices to provide fresh, locally grown produce. By demonstrating that fresh produce can be grown efficiently in urban settings, Harry Hayman is helping reimagine what is possible for food systems in cities.

The visit to Plant ARC at the University of Pennsylvania was energizing. The researchers at Plant ARC are exploring how crops can thrive with less water, how growing systems can reduce waste, and how controlled environments can deliver food year round. The collaboration between cutting edge science and community centered action holds incredible potential for advancing stronger local agriculture and a more resilient food future for Philadelphia.

Veggie Graffiti is getting closer to retail distribution. The moves are being made. The product is getting out there. The goal is clear. Fresh, local, sustainable produce in grocery stores throughout Philadelphia. This work complements the food rescue efforts of the Feed Philly Coalition, creating a comprehensive approach to food security that addresses both immediate needs and long term solutions.

## Economy League: Shaping Policy and Building Equity

As Senior Fellow for The Food Economy and Policy at the [Economy League of Greater Philadelphia](https://economyleague.org/), Harry Hayman occupied a unique position in 2025 at the intersection of business, policy, and social impact. The work focused on institutional procurement, controlled environment agriculture, and policy changes that incentivize businesses to reduce waste while feeding hungry communities.

The 6th Annual PAGE and ELGP Summit brought together leaders exploring strategies for fostering equitable economic growth and building diverse, inclusive local economies. Harry Hayman led a panel discussion on Procurement in the Food Economy. The summit featured opening remarks by Mayor Cherelle Parker and emphasized the city's goal of creating economic opportunity for all Philadelphians.

The Equitable Growth Learning Exchange (EGLE) conference in Washington DC connected Philadelphia leaders with best practices in equitable economic development. Harry Hayman participated as an emissary of the Economy League, bringing insights back to inform local strategies.

The Congress for Global Africa's "Shaping the Future" conference provided opportunities to connect Philadelphia with Africa and the Caribbean through trade, innovation, food systems, and inclusive growth. These international connections demonstrate that while Harry Hayman's work is deeply rooted in Philadelphia, the principles and practices have global applications.

## Another Three Hearts Experience: Telling Stories That Matter

[Another Three Hearts Experience](https://another3heartsexperience.com/) continued producing compelling narratives in 2025. The I AM HUNGRY documentary captured the jaw dropping reality that 312,000 Philadelphia citizens face food insecurity. Through interviews with local and federal officials, professors, medical professionals, advocates, people working toward solutions, and individuals experiencing food insecurity firsthand, the film puts faces and voices to the statistics.

The street interviews revealed something powerful. Philadelphians are not resigned to hunger as a permanent condition. They are demanding change from government leadership, business communities, nonprofit organizations, and anyone with influence. The documentary will be released soon, and it stands as a compelling reminder of why this work matters and why it cannot slow down.

The Writing Rooms launched in June under the Another Three Hearts umbrella. Every Tuesday, Philadelphia's creative community gathered to connect, create, and grow. The space offered internship credits and paid opportunities. It became a place where aspiring writers could develop their craft alongside experienced storytellers.

## Harry Hayman Creative: Where Art Meets Action

[Harry Hayman Creative](https://harryhaymancreative.com/) served as the umbrella for exploring creative aspects of all this work. From documentary filmmaking to curating art exhibitions, from screenwriting to producing live storytelling events, Harry Hayman's creative spirit drove innovative initiatives that promote artistic expression while supporting charitable causes.

The curation of art exhibitions throughout 2025 demonstrated this intersection of creativity and social impact. The Source of Self Regard exhibition at InLiquid Gallery, curated by Tayyib Smith, brought together six remarkable Philadelphia connected artists whose work explored the interior world of the Black self with honesty, beauty, and emotional depth. The exhibition became more than an art display. It became an experience that lingered.

Bespoke Matter at Park Towne Place, curated by InLiquid, featured five talented local artists reimagining decorative arts with bold, innovative, and unapologetically Philly works. Sky Slips Through Stone at AUTOMAT transformed stone, water, and weather into an ongoing conversation about kinship with the natural world.

These exhibitions were not separate from the food security work or the jazz preservation or the hospitality consulting. They were part of the same ecosystem. Art builds community. Art tells truth. Art creates pathways for understanding and connection.

## Youth Investment: Building Tomorrow's Leaders

Throughout 2025, Harry Hayman remained committed to investing in Philadelphia's youth. The Alan Horwitz "Sixth Man" Center powered by Philadelphia Youth Basketball represented the difference between charity and strategic investment. Intentional programs that teach leadership, resilience, and life skills create measurable impact on young people and neighborhoods.

The partnership with Cosmic Writers celebrated a Philadelphia nonprofit transforming young lives by treating children as authors from day one. Every voice matters. Every story deserves to be heard. The Hayman Foundation's support of this work reflected a belief that literacy, creativity, and self expression are foundational to building strong communities.

ManUpPHL and the work of Solomon Jones demonstrated what happens when a city refuses to give up on its sons. Through mentorship, accountability, and genuine care, young men are developing the skills and confidence to become leaders in their families and communities.

Youth Emergency Service at HopePHL hosted events where pajamas, home cooked meals, and genuine connection reminded everyone why community matters. Young leaders like Ms. Essence and Freddy cooked alongside mentors. Organizations like Saving Our Sons & Daughters, Inc. made hope real in Philadelphia one young person at a time.

## Arts and Culture: Feeding the Soul

Philadelphia's arts and culture scene exploded in 2025, and Harry Hayman was present for many of the moments that mattered most.

MOMIX's Alice at the Annenberg Center defied reality and transformed imagination into pure visual magic. The dancers morphed, disappeared, and multiplied, creating a Wonderland that challenged the senses and delighted the mind.

Cirque Dreams Holidaze at the Miller Theater delivered pure, unapologetic, gravity defying joy. Jaw dropping acrobats, aerialists ignoring physics, Broadway level production value. The 1918 theater held court like the elegant elder it is.

Shadow Cities at the Annenberg Center brought together Ephrat Asherie Dance and Arturo O'Farrill for a night that felt far bigger than a performance. The dancers carved through the air with movement that carried memory and urgency. Arturo summoned entire worlds from the piano. The result was a living city made from rhythm, sweat, spirit, and imagination.

David Byrne set the whole damn universe on fire at THE MET Philly. For two hours, thousands of strangers became one heartbeat. It was not just a concert. It was a transformation. A revival disguised as a show.

BalletX celebrated 20 years of innovation, artistry, and inspiration in contemporary dance. The retrospective honored the company's legacy and its visionary founder, Christine Cox. From breathtaking performances to a global influence rooted in the Philly community, the celebration highlighted the courage, creativity, and dedication that make BalletX a leader in the performing arts.

The Velvet Whip became the new creative pulse of Philadelphia where raw art and live experimentation reshaped the city's nightlife identity. Femme Fetale delivered a fever dream in velvet and voltage. Rouge Nightingale's soaring opera note turned chandeliers into stars.

## Restaurants: Where Flavor Meets Community

Philadelphia's restaurant scene continued thriving in 2025, and Harry Hayman explored many of the spaces that define the city's culinary identity.

HoneySuckle remained a legend. Every plate tells a story. Every flavor feeds the soul. Omar Tate's recent Pew Fellowship recognized his visionary work in Black culinary excellence and community building. HoneySuckle is more than a restaurant. It is a cultural archive, a masterclass in craft and creativity, and a shining example of Philadelphia's world class food scene.

Gather Food Hall at the Bulletin Building marked a new era of flavor and community. Curated by local chefs and designed with purpose, each meal supports students, empowers entrepreneurs, and celebrates culture.

Unit Su Vege proved that sustainable dining can be indulgent, flavorful, and unforgettable. One hundred percent vegetarian and mostly vegan dishes that surprise and delight.

STATIC brought an electric charge to Washington Square West. The newest venture from the Next of Kin team delivered process driven perfection. Every infusion, every syrup, every specialized ingredient represented hours of preparation. The Sazerac was flawless. Balanced, bold, smooth.

La Chinesca on Spring Garden Street served bold flavors and even bolder vibes. The salt and pepper squid Caesar stopped conversations. Poison Heart turned cocktails into confessions. Frankie's Summer Club transformed an old courtyard into a lush garden getaway that felt like the Amalfi Coast without leaving Philly.

Cantina Dos Segundos delivered legendary nights. Vegan empanadas that wow. A tequila and mezcal lineup that begs for research. A vibe that makes every moment unforgettable.

## Community Organizations: The Real Heroes

The strength of Philadelphia comes from the organizations and individuals doing the daily work that holds communities together.

JUST Strategies spent five years proving that real community centered leadership can reshape Philadelphia. The work of Dwyane Wharton and the team turns equity, accountability, and systems change into action rather than talk.

Broad Street Love showed what happens when compassion is not just talk but action. The Open House plus Clothing and Hygiene Drive created a space where support meets humanity and everyone leaves reminded why this work matters.

St. John's Hospice provided a sanctuary of hope where dignity, hope, and humanity thrive daily through compassionate service to the city's most vulnerable neighbors. Boot Up Philly 2025 filled the Cathedral lot with compassion, collaboration, and care. Led by Kris Jaeger, the event brought warmth, essentials, and dignity to those in need.

Finanta Credit Union opened a new branch in Aramingo Village, bringing real financial inclusion, support for local businesses, and economic opportunity to working class Philadelphia neighborhoods.

The Ship Shop PHL opened at Broad and Allegheny with purpose and pride. Led by Rachel, a visionary Black woman entrepreneur, the modern pack and ship store goes beyond convenience, offering essential services with heart while empowering the local community.

Cultivate Small Business went national. What started as a local Philadelphia effort has grown into a program reaching food founders across the entire country. Ellen Rosenberg from Santander recognized that small food businesses rarely lack talent. They lack access, capital, networks, and structured support.

## North Broad: Transformation in Real Time

The State of North Broad event in December offered a moment of clarity. The corridor is no longer quietly transforming. It is moving with velocity. Investments are real. Stakeholders are aligned. The momentum is visible in every direction.

Shalimar Thomas and the team at the North Broad Renaissance guided the conversation with a clear vision. Rising investment, institutional alignment, cultural growth, and community centered progress are redefining the corridor's future. The energy in the room was palpable. North Broad is entering its strongest era yet.

## Personal Moments: Celebrating Life and Love

Amidst all the work, 2025 offered moments of pure joy and connection.

The wedding celebration of Paul and Laurie at Terrain in Philadelphia was unforgettable. Filled with laughter, heartfelt speeches, dancing, and moments of pure joy, the evening was a true testament to love, friendship, and community.

Nights at City Winery discovering The Slambovian Circus of Dreams. Evenings at Southwark with Matthew Stebbins celebrating friendship and purpose. Sunset therapy in Sea Isle City. The perfect Philly afternoon at the Christmas Village where tradition defines the city.

These moments matter because they remind us why we do the work. Community is not abstract. It is real people sharing meals, celebrating milestones, and building memories together.

## WHYY: The Voice That Matters

Throughout 2025, Harry Hayman continued supporting [WHYY](https://whyy.org/) as a member and advocate. WHYY is more than a radio station or a TV channel. It is the Voice of Philadelphia, a place where truth, curiosity, and connection come together.

In a world filled with noise, WHYY stays calm, clear, and local. Whether it is a local business finding its audience, a neighborhood coming together around an issue, or a young student inspired by a PBS documentary, these moments matter. WHYY coverage of Feed Philly Coalition, the I AM HUNGRY documentary, SOUTH, HoneySuckle, and other initiatives helped amplify important stories and push Philadelphia toward building systems that work for everyone.

## Looking Forward to 2026

As Harry Hayman stands at the threshold of 2026, the momentum from 2025 creates extraordinary possibilities.

The I AM HUNGRY documentary will be released. The footage will spark conversations. The voices will demand action. Philadelphia will be challenged to meet the moment.

The Feed Philly Coalition will continue advocating for policy changes and building partnerships that transform food systems. More organizations will join. More campaigns will launch. More communities will be served.

The Philadelphia Jazz Experience will bring more performances, more education, more preservation. The vision for a national multi day jazz festival will move closer to reality. Young people will discover jazz as a living art form that belongs to them.

SOUTH will keep firing on all cylinders. World class jazz. Exceptional food. Perfect cocktails. A cultural destination that demonstrates what Philadelphia hospitality can be at its finest.

Veggie Graffiti will move closer to retail distribution. Fresh, local, sustainable produce will reach more neighborhoods. Urban agriculture will prove itself as a viable solution to food security challenges.

Gemini Hospitality Consultants will mentor more emerging businesses. More restaurateurs will receive guidance. More concepts will launch. More success stories will be written.

The Economy League work will continue shaping policy at the intersection of food economy, institutional procurement, and equitable development. The conversations will expand. The partnerships will deepen. The impact will grow.

Another Three Hearts Experience will produce more documentaries, host more writing rooms, create more opportunities for storytellers to share narratives that move hearts and inspire action.

Harry Hayman Creative will continue curating exhibitions, supporting artists, and demonstrating that creativity is not separate from community development but essential to it.

Youth programs will expand. More young people will receive mentorship. More skills will be developed. More futures will be built.

Arts and culture will continue thriving. Performances will astound. Exhibitions will challenge. Experiences will transform.

Philadelphia will keep showing up. Keep creating. Keep demanding better. Keep building the city we all deserve.

## The Real Work

But here is the truth. None of this work belongs to one person. Harry Hayman did not build any of this alone. Every initiative mentioned in this blog exists because of partnerships, collaborations, volunteers, donors, staff members, board members, community leaders, and everyday Philadelphians who decided to show up and participate.

The Feed Philly Coalition works because restaurants donate food, nonprofits distribute it, volunteers show up, and policymakers listen. The Philadelphia Jazz Experience thrives because musicians perform, audiences attend, educators teach, and donors support. SOUTH succeeds because staff members deliver excellence every night, artists bring their best, and neighbors keep coming back.

Veggie Graffiti grows because researchers share knowledge, farmers provide guidance, and communities embrace innovation. Gemini Hospitality Consultants helps businesses because clients trust the process, implement strategies, and commit to their visions.

The Economy League shapes policy because data informs decisions, stakeholders collaborate across sectors, and leaders prioritize equity. Documentary filmmaking happens because people share their stories, crews dedicate their skills, and funders invest in truth telling.

Youth programs succeed because mentors commit time, organizations provide structure, families engage, and young people show up ready to learn and grow. Arts organizations flourish because artists create fearlessly, curators vision boldly, and audiences support consistently.

This is how cities change. Not through individual heroism but through collective power. Not through single actions but through sustained commitment. Not through grand declarations but through daily work that compounds over time.

## What Matters Most

If there is one message from 2025 that carries into 2026, it is this. Show up. Do the work. Build relationships. Listen more than you speak. Collaborate more than you compete. Invest in people. Support local. Buy from your neighbors. Eat at local restaurants. Attend community events. Volunteer your time. Donate what you can. Vote. Advocate. Create. Connect.

Philadelphia does not need saviors. Philadelphia needs participants. People willing to roll up their sleeves, contribute their skills, share their resources, and commit to the long haul.

Harry Hayman has spent over 30 years doing exactly that. From washing dishes at 17 to founding multiple organizations addressing food insecurity, cultural preservation, and community development, the journey has been about showing up consistently with intention, humility, and genuine care for this city and its people.

The work is not glamorous most days. It is meetings and emails and budgets and logistics. It is difficult conversations and setbacks and compromises. It is slow progress and incremental gains. But it is also transformative. It is connections formed and systems changed and lives improved and communities strengthened.

## A City Worth Fighting For

Philadelphia deserves this effort. The city that gave us jazz legends and culinary innovation and revolutionary history deserves people who refuse to accept inequality, food insecurity, cultural erasure, and economic exclusion as permanent conditions.

This is the largest poorest city in America. That statistic is unacceptable. But it is also changeable. When money circulates locally, when businesses support workers fairly, when institutions invest in communities, when policies reflect values of equity and justice, cities transform.

2025 showed glimpses of what is possible. Small businesses opening. Youth programs expanding. Arts organizations thriving. Food rescue systems growing. Jazz preservation strengthening. Community bonds deepening.

2026 offers opportunities to build on that momentum. To scale what works. To fix what does not. To try new approaches. To strengthen partnerships. To welcome more voices. To distribute resources more equitably. To create systems that serve everyone, not just the fortunate few.

## Gratitude

As this reflection on 2025 comes to a close, gratitude feels like the most honest response.

Gratitude for every person who volunteered at Feed Philly Coalition events. For every restaurant that donated food. For every organization that partnered on policy advocacy. For every community member who shared their story for the documentary.

Gratitude for every musician who performed with the Philadelphia Jazz Experience. For every educator who taught young people about jazz history. For every audience member who filled seats and supported artists.

Gratitude for every staff member at SOUTH who delivered exceptional service night after night. For every chef who prepared beautiful food. For every bartender who crafted perfect cocktails. For every artist who shared their gift.

Gratitude for every client who trusted Gemini Hospitality Consultants with their vision. For every entrepreneur who took risks to build something meaningful. For every hospitality worker who brings passion to their craft daily.

Gratitude for every researcher working on innovative agriculture solutions. For every farmer growing food sustainably. For every advocate pushing for better food systems.

Gratitude for every colleague at the Economy League shaping equitable economic development. For every policymaker willing to listen and act. For every community leader bringing residents into decision making processes.

Gratitude for every artist who shared their work. For every curator who created space for voices to be heard. For every storyteller who captured truth with honesty and humanity.

Gratitude for every mentor investing in young people. For every organization creating pathways for youth to thrive. For every family supporting their children's dreams.

Gratitude for every neighbor who showed up at community events. For every person who bought local, supported small businesses, and invested in Philadelphia's future.

## Here's to 2026

The calendar turned. The city exhaled. And here we are.

Ready to do the work. Ready to show up. Ready to build. Ready to fight for the Philadelphia we believe in.

2025 was transformational. 2026 will be even better. Not because of wishes or hopes or abstract ideas, but because people will continue rolling up their sleeves, contributing their gifts, and refusing to accept things as they are.

Philadelphia is worth it. This city and its people deserve systems that work, opportunities that are accessible, culture that is preserved and celebrated, and communities that are strong and connected.

Harry Hayman is committed to that vision. Not as a hero. Not as a savior. But as a fellow Philadelphian who loves this city, believes in its people, and refuses to stop working toward the future we all deserve.

Thank you for being part of 2025. Welcome to 2026. Let's make it count.

The work continues.
