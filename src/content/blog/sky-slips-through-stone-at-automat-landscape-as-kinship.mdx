  Harry Hayman reflects on “Sky Slips Through Stone” at AUTOMAT, where five
  artists transform stone, water, and weather into an ongoing conversation about
  kinship with the natural world. Curated by Danielle Degon Rhodes and Addison
  Namnoum, and supported by AUTOMAT Collective and InLiquid, this show embodies
  empathy instead of extraction.

For Harry Hayman, some exhibitions don’t just show you art—they invite you to feel the room itself exhale. **“Sky Slips Through Stone”** at AUTOMAT is one of those rare shows.

Featuring the work of **Hannah Bates, Anna Bockrath, Francesca Lally, Cecilia McKinnon, and Stephanie Van Riet**, the exhibition treats stone, water, weather, and living things as parts of one continuous conversation. This is landscape understood as kinship, not conquest. It is empathy instead of extraction.



Curated with precision and care by **Danielle Degon Rhodes** and **Addison Namnoum**, the exhibition feels more like an ecology than a gallery show. Each piece resonates with the others, together forming a call to see our environments not as objects to dominate, but as partners in living.

### AUTOMAT and InLiquid: The Pulse of Philly Arts

At the heart of this experience is **AUTOMAT Collective**, an artist-run sparkplug inside the Crane Arts building. These are the kinds of spaces where Philadelphia’s most daring and inventive work takes root.

The show is also buoyed by **InLiquid**, a powerhouse that Harry Hayman often points to as one of the city’s cultural engines. By giving artists, curators, and collectors room to grow, InLiquid ensures Philly’s creative pulse stays loud, public, and collectible.
