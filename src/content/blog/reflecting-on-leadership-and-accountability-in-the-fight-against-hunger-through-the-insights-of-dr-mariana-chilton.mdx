The I AM HUNGRY in Philadelphia documentary project continues to evolve as one of the most earnest and unfiltered examinations of hunger in the city. A recent and particularly meaningful moment in the development of the film involved a deep engagement with the ideas and scholarship of Dr. Mariana Chilton. Her work, her questions, and her challenges left a lasting impact on the project’s direction. In this blog, the project team reflects on that experience and the broader truths it reveals about hunger in America.

Dr. Chilton is widely recognized as a national voice on food insecurity and poverty. Her research and advocacy illuminate the structural forces that shape the daily lives of millions of Americans who experience food hardship. When the I AM HUNGRY team approached her for an interview, they knew they were seeking the insight of a leading scholar. What they underestimated was the transformative nature of her engagement.

Before she agreed to appear on camera, Dr. Chilton insisted on interviewing the project’s creator, Harry Hayman. The conversation did not focus on filming techniques, timeline logistics, or distribution plans. Instead, she centered the discussion on intention and purpose. She wanted to know why this documentary was being made, how its creators understood the concept of ending hunger, and whether they were prepared to confront the uncomfortable realities that accompany genuine systems level work.

This moment became a defining experience for the project. It captured the essence of who Dr. Chilton is. She brings a profound sense of responsibility to her work. She protects the dignity of the families and individuals who live the realities she studies. She demands seriousness, honesty, and emotional clarity from anyone who claims to care about this issue. For her, addressing hunger is not an abstract exercise. It is a moral obligation that requires direct acknowledgment of generational trauma, systemic inequity, policy failure, and the deliberate structures that keep people trapped in cycles of deprivation.

The project team describes her scholarship as a mirror. It is unflinching and at times painful because it exposes truths the country often avoids. Her writing and public commentary bring forward the human consequences of policy decisions, economic pressures, and social fragmentation. Her participation in the documentary is therefore not simply informative. It is essential. She provides the intellectual and ethical grounding needed for a project committed to portraying hunger honestly.

One of the most powerful themes emerging from Dr. Chilton’s work is the understanding that hunger is not an accident. It is not the result of personal failure, isolated misfortune, or inevitable social forces. Hunger persists because of choices. It persists because of policies that deprioritize basic human needs. It persists because the systems designed to support communities often underperform or fail altogether. If hunger is the outcome of choices, then different choices can eliminate it. This framing is central to the mission of I AM HUNGRY in Philadelphia.

The experience with Dr. Chilton also reinforced the responsibility the documentary carries. Telling the story of hunger is not enough. The project must challenge the structures that produce the crisis. It must amplify the voices of those who seldom receive public platforms. It must encourage Philadelphians and policymakers to choose compassion, justice, and structural reform over complacency. Dr. Chilton’s insistence on accountability deepened the commitment of the entire team to approach their work with greater intention and rigor.

As I AM HUNGRY in Philadelphia moves forward, it continues to gather insights from residents, scholars, advocates, and frontline workers. The presence of Dr. Chilton’s perspective provides a guiding framework for the documentary’s purpose. It reminds the team that every interview and every narrative must be grounded in respect and in a commitment to changing the system that produces hunger in the first place.

The documentary highlights many faces and many truths. Some of these truths are painful. All of them are necessary. The project also highlights a consistent belief expressed across every conversation. Philadelphia has the power to solve hunger. The city has the people, the expertise, the moral sensibility, and the civic energy required to create a better food future.

The reflections shared in this blog attest to the impact of Dr. Mariana Chilton on the ongoing development of the film. They also reaffirm the core mission of the project. I AM HUNGRY in Philadelphia aims to tell the truth, elevate unheard voices, and push for the systems level transformation the city urgently needs.
