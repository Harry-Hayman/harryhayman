**Philadelphia PA, December 19, 2025**

Philadelphia entrepreneur, food economy advocate, and community builder **Harry G. Hayman IV** today issued a statement recognizing WHYY for its many years of coverage highlighting his work across the city. That work spans food insecurity, controlled environment agriculture, mutual aid, hospitality, arts, and civic engagement.

“I am sincerely appreciative of WHYY’s long standing interest in my work and contributions to Philadelphia,” Hayman said. “They have covered nearly every chapter of my professional and civic life, and I do not take that lightly.”

Over the years, WHYY has featured Hayman and his initiatives across a wide range of stories, including:

1. The Feed Philly Coalition’s anti hunger initiatives
2. The introduction of Controlled Environment Agriculture into the School District of Philadelphia
3. Food waste reduction and food rescue programs
4. Volunteerism and mutual aid impact
5. High profile civic moments connected to the Democratic National Convention and the 2026 Semiquincentennial
6. Arts, culture, and community building through SOUTH Restaurant and Jazz Club
7. Youth focused service efforts across Philadelphia

“Very few journalists or outlets have covered this full range of work,” Hayman added. “For that, I truly want to say thank you.”

## A Continued Partnership Rooted in Integrity and Civic Responsibility

Hayman also emphasized his ongoing communication with WHYY leadership and its editorial team.

“WHYY plays an essential role in shaping civic understanding in Philadelphia,” he said. “I look forward to continuing the dialogue with their leadership as we collectively strengthen our shared commitment to journalistic integrity, transparency, and community impact.”

“Like any long relationship, there are moments for clarification,” Hayman said. “What matters most is that WHYY and I remain aligned on the big picture, serving Philadelphia’s residents, uplifting underserved communities, and telling the truth about the challenges we face and the work being done to solve them.”
