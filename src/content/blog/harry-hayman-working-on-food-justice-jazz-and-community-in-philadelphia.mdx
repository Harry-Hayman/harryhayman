Sometimes I wonder, what is all the hard work for? Does it even matter the effort I put into addressing food insecurity, supporting the local economy, promoting jazz, and trying to make a difference in the community through hospitality? There are days when it feels overwhelming, when I ask myself if any of this truly matters. But then I see small gestures of appreciation, moments when people acknowledge the effort, and it reminds me why I keep going. Even small impacts matter, and the little wins make the journey worthwhile.

Over the years, my work has been mentioned in [**WHYY**](https://whyy.org/) and other local outlets. Seeing my perspective and efforts reflected in public media is humbling, not because it highlights me personally, but because it helps shed light on issues that need attention. I have been referenced under my names: **Harry Hayman, Harry G. Hayman IV, and Harrison Graham Hayman IV**, and each mention connects back to the work itself, food access, community development, or cultural preservation.

## Harry Hayman as a Food Activist

Working on food systems and addressing food insecurity has been a central part of what I do. As a **senior fellow for food economy and policy at The Economy League of Greater Philadelphia**, I spend a lot of time thinking about the inefficiencies in how food moves through the city from large events to everyday food service. There is often a tremendous amount of food that does not get used, not because people want to waste it, but because the system itself is complicated and fragmented.

In [**WHYY’s story on volunteering at food pantries during the holidays**](https://whyy.org/articles/volunteering-food-pantry-philadelphia-holidays/), I spoke about how catering large events and feeding big crowds often leaves much of the food without a home afterward. Seeing that reporting help draw attention to the challenges in the food system was encouraging. It reminded me that even small efforts like connecting surplus food with people who need it can ripple out in meaningful ways.

Another important part of this work has been thinking about local economic impact. In [**WHYY’s coverage of Fox Chase Farm**](https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-fox-chase-farm-school-district-students/), I discussed how nearly half of institutional food spending happens outside Philadelphia. That represents a missed opportunity for local jobs, supply chains, and keeping money circulating in the city. Programs like Fox Chase Farm are essential because they engage young people in agriculture and food systems while building awareness that the choices we make about food have broader economic and social consequences.

Food work is not just about feeding people. It is about creating systems that reduce waste, support local economies, and build resilience. It is about asking how we can do better, how we can connect resources with people and communities in need, and how to make solutions sustainable over the long term.

## Harry Hayman as a Jazz Enthusiast

Jazz has been a lifelong passion, and working on Philadelphia’s jazz scene has been one of the ways I try to give back to the community culturally. As **co-coordinator of the Philadelphia Jazz Festival**, I have worked to highlight the city’s deep jazz history while also giving space for emerging talent to shine.

In [**WHYY’s article on dueling jazz festivals**](https://whyy.org/articles/dueling-jazz-festivals-bring-philadelphia-jazz-appreciation-month-to-a-crescendo/), I talked about the importance of celebrating jazz as a living art form, not just as something from the past. There is a lot happening right now that is exciting and connects directly to the next generation of musicians. Being able to help create events that bring musicians, audiences, and students together is a small way to support the continuity and growth of this culture.

Jazz work teaches patience and persistence. It is not just about performance. It is about community, mentorship, and creating spaces where music can thrive. Each festival, each performance, and each conversation with artists is a reminder that cultural work matters even if it does not always make headlines.

## Harry Hayman in Hospitality and Community Development

Hospitality has always been intertwined with my other work. As **director of operations for the Bynum Hospitality Group**, which owns South Jazz Kitchen and Southside, I have seen firsthand how restaurants and cultural spaces can be catalysts for neighborhood development. Small changes like revitalizing a street or filling an empty lot with a new space can gradually transform a neighborhood’s energy and opportunities.

[**WHYY highlighted my work in North Broad Street business improvement**](https://whyy.org/articles/north-broad-street-business-improvement-district-development/), where I shared how streetscape changes from empty lots to new buildings affect the vibrancy of the area. Similarly, in [**Billy Penn’s coverage**](https://billypenn.com/2022/09/28/north-broad-business-improvement-district-philadelphia-renaissance/), I reflected on decades of experience in Philadelphia’s restaurant scene and how projects like Zanzibar Blue and Center City SIPS contributed to neighborhood growth. These experiences show that even small efforts in hospitality and community planning can have lasting impact when sustained over time.

## Reflections and Gratitude

Being recognized by **WHYY** and other outlets is never about personal accolades. It is about showing that persistent, thoughtful work whether in food systems, jazz, or community development can have a tangible impact. Each mention reminds me that even small efforts matter and that what feels incremental can ripple out in meaningful ways across a community.

These experiences give me hope and motivation to keep working. The challenges are many and the problems we face are complex, but every little effort counts. I am grateful to everyone who contributes, supports, and believes in this work. Together, by working on food systems, nurturing culture, and supporting our neighborhoods, we can build a stronger, more connected Philadelphia.
