As if Philadelphia needed another reminder of their brilliance, accolades keep rolling in. Harry Hayman proudly highlights that Omar Tate, the visionary behind HoneySuckle, recently received a Pew Fellowship. This is big — career-defining, nationally significant, and city-elevating recognition. And it is richly, unapologetically deserved.

Omar Tate’s work extends far beyond cooking. It is about storytelling, community-building, reclaiming, reimagining, and redefining what Black culinary excellence looks like in America.
