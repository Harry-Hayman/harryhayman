I had the honor and the fire in my chest to step in as a practice judge for the Impact Labs Fair City Challenge pitch sessions. The energy in that room was alive. You could feel it from the very first introduction. This is not what some people might call innovation theater. This is not a stage play with flashy slides and buzzwords that disappear the moment the lights go out. In Philadelphia, we do not just talk the talk. We walk the walk. What I witnessed were real founders addressing real problems with real solutions that can and will move dollars, generate jobs, and create opportunities in the places where they are needed most.

Being part of this effort under the banner of the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia filled me with pride. The Economy League is more than an institution. It is an engine room that keeps pushing, connecting, and powering inclusive growth across our region. It brings together anchors, entrepreneurs, and capital, all under one roof of shared purpose. It is a place where ideas that once lived only in a deck or a brainstorm find their way into contracts, procurement pipelines, pilots, and ultimately lasting economic change. In that space, you do not wait for transformation to drift down from somewhere else. You roll up your sleeves and you build it yourself with the people standing beside you.

I want to pause here and acknowledge someone who made this moment possible. Massive respect and gratitude go to Meg Niman. Watching Meg orchestrate these sessions was like watching a conductor with a symphony. Every detail mattered. Every founder mattered. Every second was treated as precious. She brought precision, a deeply human touch, and an uncompromising focus on impact. Meg is not just supporting entrepreneurs. She is challenging them, holding them accountable, and giving them the kind of constructive push that makes the difference between a good idea and a market ready solution. In a landscape full of cheerleading and handshakes, Meg is raising the bar for what true support actually looks like.

To the teams that are stepping up with your bold ideas and your ambitious visions, hear me clearly. Philadelphia is watching. This city is not just looking for the next headline. It is looking for the next breakthrough that proves what is possible when vision meets execution. So bring your receipts. Bring your customers. Bring your pilots. Bring your procurement pathways. Bring your measurable outcomes that demonstrate your impact. This is not a stage for vanity. It is a launchpad for traction. The people of this city want to see you succeed, not just pitch.

The beauty of the Fair City Challenge is that it is not abstract. It is not theory. It is grounded in the realities that our communities face every single day. Food insecurity. Health disparities. Economic inequality. Barriers to entrepreneurship. These are not buzzwords. They are lived experiences. And when founders step into that arena with solutions built to confront those realities, the room changes. You can sense that spark where resilience meets creativity. That is when a pitch session becomes something greater. It becomes a moment of alignment between talent, capital, and purpose.

The work ahead will not be easy. Building inclusive economies never is. But that is exactly why we need spaces like this. Spaces where boldness is rewarded and where accountability is non negotiable. Spaces where a city known for its grit and its heart can put both qualities to work in service of change. The Fair City Challenge is a reminder that progress is not passive. It is active. It is messy. It is collaborative. And it is ours to claim if we are willing to keep showing up and keep putting in the work.



What excites me most is knowing that Philadelphia has the raw material to lead in this space. We have founders who are not afraid to tackle the hardest problems. We have anchors and institutions willing to lean in and invest. We have networks of mentors, investors, and civic leaders who understand that inclusive growth is not charity. It is strategy. When more people thrive, the region thrives. When more opportunities reach communities that have been locked out, the economy as a whole becomes stronger and more resilient. That is not rhetoric. That is fact.

I left those sessions feeling grateful, inspired, and motivated. Grateful for the chance to serve. Inspired by the courage and creativity of the founders. Motivated by the reminder that our city is filled with people who are unwilling to settle for the status quo. That combination is powerful. It is exactly what Philadelphia needs to build the next chapter of its story.

So let us continue. Let us keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Let us keep holding each other accountable to outcomes that actually matter. Let us keep celebrating the builders, the doers, and the risk takers. Because at the end of the day, this city will not be defined by what we say in rooms like these. It will be defined by what we build once we leave them.

The Fair City Challenge is not a one time event. It is a signal. A signal that Philadelphia is ready to take its ideas and turn them into industries. A signal that inclusive growth is not a slogan but a strategy. A signal that we are not waiting for change. We are building it. And if the energy from these sessions is any indication, we are only just getting started.
