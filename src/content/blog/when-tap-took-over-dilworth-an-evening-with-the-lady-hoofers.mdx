A couple of weeks ago, I had one of those nights that remind you why living in Philadelphia is such a gift. It was one of those summer evenings where everything clicked—the sky put on its best show, the breeze actually cooperated, and Dilworth Park transformed into what felt like the city’s front-porch living room. And right there, in the heart of Center City, The Lady Hoofers Tap Ensemble lit up the plaza with rhythms that made the whole place feel alive.

Now, if you’ve never seen The Lady Hoofers before, let me tell you—this all-women tap company is something special. Founded in 2011 by Kat Richter, the company has grown into Philadelphia’s only all-female tap ensemble. They’ve been on stages big and small, from the Kimmel Center to community festivals, always carrying the tradition of tap while pushing it forward with their own contemporary flair. What makes them stand out isn’t just their technique (which is razor-sharp) but their energy: sly smiles, contagious joy, and the kind of rhythms that pull you in whether you know a shuffle from a stomp or not.

At Dilworth, it was tap like thunder on stone and steel, echoing against City Hall’s granite walls. You could see strangers turn toward each other and start clapping on the same beat, people who had never met suddenly part of the same chorus. That’s the magic of syncopation—it sneaks into your body before your brain even has time to catch up. One second you’re passing through the plaza on your commute, and the next you’re nodding, clapping, maybe even swaying along.

The performance was part of the free summer series at Dilworth Park, one of those ongoing gems that makes Philly summers so rich. Families spread out on blankets, couples leaned against railings, kids danced in the fountains just steps away. Some folks clearly came with the show circled on their calendars, while others were just “stopping for a minute” on their way somewhere else—though more than a few of those commuters ended up staying until the end.

And can we talk about the setting? A big thank you to Chaddsford Winery for bringing their easy-sipping vibes to the night. There’s something about sipping a chilled glass of wine while watching tap dancers play granite like it’s an instrument—stone, steel, and shoes blending into this very urban symphony.

That’s what I love most about these free performances. They democratize art. You don’t need a ticket or a tux. You don’t need to know the names of the steps or the history of the form (though The Lady Hoofers are steeped in both). You just need to show up with open ears and let yourself be surprised by the ways artists can transform a public space.

For me, watching The Lady Hoofers was more than just entertainment—it was a reminder of how rhythm connects us. Tap has always been about more than just dance. It’s conversation, community, improvisation, and tradition passed down foot to foot, beat to beat. Seeing it alive in the middle of our city, surrounded by skyscrapers and the hum of traffic, made me grateful for Philadelphia’s commitment to making the arts accessible.

So if you missed this one, don’t worry—there’s always a next show. That’s the beauty of summer in Philly. Grab a friend, bring your sway, and let the city surprise you.

Philly, keep dancing.
