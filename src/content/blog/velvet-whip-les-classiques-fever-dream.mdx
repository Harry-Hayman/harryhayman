Sometimes a night doesn’t just happen—it *possesses* you. That was *Les Classiques* at Velvet Whip Speakeasy: a phantasmagoric trip through glitter, latex, aerial artistry, and sensual slow burns that leaves you spinning long after the lights go dim.

## Setting the Stage: Velvet Whip Speakeasy

Tucked into Center City at 319 N. 11th Street, Philly’s Velvet Whip is no ordinary venue. It’s a members-only arts & social club and clandestine performance hub, where jazz collides with burlesque, comedy, experimental jam, opera, and everything in between :contentReference\[oaicite:0]\{index=0}. Here, weekly showcases blur the line between audience and experience :contentReference\[oaicite:1]\{index=1}.

## Electric Vibe — “Les Classiques” in Full Throttle

Hosted by Texas’s own **Duchess of Debauchery, Delilah DuBois**, the room didn’t just watch—it levitated. And when Philadelphia’s crowned burlesque royalty, **Goldi Fox** (Miss Hollywood Queen of Burlesque 2024, Princess of the Tease 2024, Duchess of Viva Las Vegas 2023) ripped into her vignettes, things tipped into fever dream territory :contentReference\[oaicite:2]\{index=2}.

## A Roster That Raises the Bar (and the Pulse)

* **Elle Dorado** — New Orleans’s Queen of Burlesque 2014, Miss Exotic World 2nd Runner-Up.
* **Lucious Lizzie** — Radiant allure incarnate.
* **Mackenzie Moltov** — Philly’s hottest clown—and yes, that’s a compliment.
* **FAGL ROQ** — The tight-end of burlesque, literally.

* **Calamity Chang** — The Asian Sexsation + festival director.
* **Dolly Dollface Dagger** — Puerto Rican burlesque queen with irresistible charm.
* **Nicole Burgio** — Tied by hair, fueled by fire.
* **Alexa Marie Santy** — A Philly femme-fluid dynamo, sculpting dance for every body :contentReference\[oaicite:3]\{index=3}.

Together, they spun a tapestry of slow burns, bump-n-grinds, latex glamour, aerial feats, and seductive jazz—with each solo vignette a heart-stopping masterpiece.
