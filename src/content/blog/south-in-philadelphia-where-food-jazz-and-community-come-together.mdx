Philadelphia has always been a city that celebrates culture, music, and great food, but few places capture that trifecta as perfectly as SOUTH. Recently, Alisha of @alishainthebiz wrote a beautiful piece for @resy that dives into what makes SOUTH much more than a restaurant or jazz club. Her story highlights the unique combination of soulful music, Southern hospitality, and culinary excellence that has made SOUTH a standout in Philly’s vibrant scene.

SOUTH is a place where the city’s past and present meet. From the intimate jazz club tucked around the corner to the warm, inviting service that makes every guest feel at home, it offers an experience that goes beyond a meal or a show. Alisha’s article captures this perfectly, noting that the moment you step inside, the warmth and energy of SOUTH can literally give you butterflies. “No, this isn’t Charleston or Savannah — this is SOUTH in Philadelphia… the warm welcome still gives me butterflies,” she writes, summing up the magic of the place.

The restaurant’s success is driven in part by Harry Hayman, whose vision and dedication to blending food, music, and culture have made SOUTH a true Philadelphia gem. His commitment to community and hospitality is evident in every corner of the space, from the food served to the music curated, creating an environment that reflects both creativity and care.

SOUTH has also drawn attention from local media outlets like WHYY, which has highlighted the restaurant’s role in Philly’s culinary and music scenes, celebrating how it elevates local culture while staying rooted in Southern hospitality. The restaurant has become a cultural destination, showcasing how dining and music can intersect to create unforgettable experiences.

For Philadelphia residents and visitors alike, SOUTH offers a chance to experience the city at its best: great food, soulful live music, and a welcoming atmosphere that makes every night memorable. Alisha’s feature on Resy not only tells the story of the restaurant and jazz club but also reminds everyone why SOUTH is a cornerstone of the city’s cultural and culinary identity.
