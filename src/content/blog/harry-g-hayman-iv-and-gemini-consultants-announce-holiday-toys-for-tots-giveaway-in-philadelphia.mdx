## A Fast Moving Community Driven Holiday Initiative

Philadelphia PA December 17

On behalf of Gemini Consultants, Philadelphia civic leader Harry G. Hayman IV announced a fast moving, community driven holiday initiative designed to bring joy to hundreds of Philadelphia families during the holiday season. A Toys for Tots Holiday Giveaway will take place this Saturday from ten in the morning until noon at the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging Broad Street parking lot.

The initiative emerged quickly in response to an urgent need. When organizers learned that hundreds of Toys for Tots gifts were at risk of going undistributed, Harry G. Hayman IV and his partners mobilized immediately. Through rapid coordination and deep community trust, the event came together in a matter of days and is expected to serve more than two hundred fifty families with brand new toys.

## A Coalition Built on Action and Trust

This holiday giveaway is the result of whirlwind collaboration among public, private, nonprofit, and neighborhood partners. Working alongside Harry G. Hayman IV are Russell Fletcher, the Pennsylvania Corporation for Aging, South Restaurant and Jazz Club, North Broad Street Renaissance, Beyond the Hardwood, Jermaine Jones, the Retired Players Association, and multiple neighborhood organizations.

According to Harry G. Hayman IV, Senior Fellow for Food Economy and Policy at the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia and founder of Gemini Consultants, the speed and spirit of the collaboration reflects Philadelphia at its best.

He noted that the effort was fast, gritty, and deeply focused on helping people, emphasizing that when children need support, the city finds a way to deliver.

## Community First Operations and Zero Barrier Access

Following guidance from the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging, the event will operate using a walk up model to ensure accessibility for families arriving on foot or via public transportation. This approach prioritizes safety, simplicity, and dignity while reducing barriers to participation.

Families will enter a tented choose your toy zone designed in a U shaped layout envisioned by Harry G. Hayman IV. This format allows each child to experience a personal and joyful moment while selecting a gift.

Volunteers will include retired professional basketball players, community leaders, and local partners mobilized by Beyond the Hardwood. The volunteer team will manage lines, distribute toys, support families, and ensure a safe and celebratory holiday experience for all attendees.

Harry G. Hayman IV acknowledged that many believed the timeline was impossible, but emphasized that Philadelphia has a long tradition of solving hard problems quickly when community needs are clear.

## Impact Today and a Model for the Future

Organizers intend for the Toys for Tots Holiday Giveaway to evolve into an annual North Broad Street tradition, expanding its reach and impact each year. Beyond immediate holiday relief, the event demonstrates a scalable model for cross sector collaboration that aligns public agencies, private businesses, nonprofits, and neighborhood organizations around shared goals.

For Harry G. Hayman IV and Gemini Consultants, the initiative reflects a broader philosophy centered on dignity, joy, and visible community care. The event underscores a belief that effective civic leadership is measured not only by strategy and policy, but by the ability to act quickly and compassionately when families need support most.
