### The Origins of Rocky Horror

The story of Rocky Horror began in 1973 with Richard O’Brien’s stage musical The Rocky Horror Show in London. The show was a bold celebration of camp, science fiction, and horror films from the early to mid-20th century. It quickly gained a devoted following for its fearless energy and unconventional storytelling.

The film adaptation, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, was released in 1975 by director Jim Sharman, starring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, and Barry Bostwick. The initial release was modest, but it was the midnight screenings and interactive audiences that turned it into a cult classic.

### The Cult Classic Tradition

Midnight screenings at theaters like the TLA on South Street in Philadelphia became legendary. Fans dressed as their favorite characters, shouted lines back at the screen, and danced the Time Warp together. These screenings were more than movies. They were community experiences, welcoming anyone who wanted to express themselves and celebrate creativity.

Harry reflected on those nights at the TLA where every shout, every cheer, and every laugh built a sense of belonging. The Rocky Horror Picture Show gave people permission to be themselves in a world that often demanded conformity.
