When Philadelphia's anchor institutions open their doors to local entrepreneurs and diverse business owners, the conversations that unfold go far beyond pleasantries and business card exchanges. These are the moments when procurement becomes partnership, when institutional buying power transforms into community wealth building, and when the trajectory of entire businesses shifts in a single afternoon. For Harry Hayman, attending the upcoming 7th Annual PAGE Summit on February 26, 2026, represents exactly this kind of transformative opportunity.

The PAGE Summit, orchestrated by the [Economy League of Greater Philadelphia](https://www.economyleague.org/page-summit), has evolved into something much more significant than another networking event on Philadelphia's crowded business calendar. This gathering brings together procurement professionals from institutions that collectively spend roughly $5.3 billion on goods and services annually [Economyleague](https://www.economyleague.org/resources/institutional-spend-and-potential-small-diverse-business-recovery-after-pandemic), creating pathways for local businesses to access contracts that can fundamentally change their operational scale and financial stability.

## Philadelphia's Anchor Institution Economy: Understanding the Magnitude

The concept of anchor institutions driving local economic development has gained considerable momentum in recent decades, and Philadelphia stands at the forefront of this movement. Research has found that anchor institutions in the United States directly employed nearly 10 million people and created about $1.7 trillion in economic activity [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12795), demonstrating the enormous economic footprint these organizations maintain within their communities.

What makes anchor institutions particularly valuable for regional economic development is their permanence and commitment to place. Unlike corporations that might relocate for tax advantages or market access, universities, hospitals, and government entities remain rooted in their geographic locations, creating what the [Initiative for a Competitive Inner City](https://icic.org/research/anchor-initiatives/) describes as an "inextricable link" between institutional sustainability and community vitality.

Philadelphia's anchor landscape includes powerhouse institutions like the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu/), [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/), [Children's Hospital of Philadelphia](https://www.chop.edu/), [Thomas Jefferson University](https://www.jefferson.edu/), and numerous other hospitals, universities, and government agencies. Together, these organizations form an economic engine that shapes not only employment patterns but also procurement practices, real estate development, and workforce development strategies across the Greater Philadelphia region.

## Harry Hayman's Perspective on Institutional Engagement

For someone like Harry Hayman, whose work sits at the intersection of cultural documentation, music production, and community advocacy, the PAGE Summit represents an opportunity to understand how Philadelphia's largest institutions translate stated commitments to diversity and inclusion into actual procurement dollars and contract opportunities. His approach to civic engagement consistently emphasizes authentic relationships over performative activism, making the PAGE Summit's structure particularly aligned with his values.

The event's "Cocktails with an Anchor" networking component removes many of the traditional barriers that prevent small business owners from accessing institutional decision makers. Rather than navigating complex organizational hierarchies or waiting months for procurement meetings, attendees find themselves in direct conversation with the individuals who control purchasing decisions worth millions of dollars.

This year's summit will feature a fireside conversation with [John Fry, President of Temple University](https://president.temple.edu/about-president-john-fry), whose leadership philosophy centers on using anchor institutions as catalysts for inclusive economic growth. Fry officially took office as Temple University's president on November 1, 2024, having established a reputation as both a civic leader in Philadelphia and national leader in higher education [Temple](https://president.temple.edu/about-president-john-fry). His previous tenure at Drexel University demonstrated how strategic university investments can drive neighborhood revitalization, with initiatives like the creation of [Schuylkill Yards](https://schuylkillyards.com/), a $3.5 billion mixed-use development, and extensive economic development efforts in surrounding communities.

## The Philadelphia Anchors for Growth and Equity Framework

PAGE operates as a partnership between the Economy League, the City of Philadelphia, and more than a dozen regional institutions committed to localizing and diversifying their supply chains [Economyleague](https://www.economyleague.org/page). This collaborative model represents a departure from traditional supplier diversity programs that often operate in isolation within individual institutions.

The initiative employs a three pronged approach to building an equitable business ecosystem. First, PAGE analyzes institutional purchasing data to identify "opportunity spaces" where local businesses could reasonably compete for contracts currently going to vendors outside the region. Second, the initiative works with major supply chain integrators like Aramark, Office Depot, and hospital Group Purchasing Organizations to incorporate local purchasing commitments into their operations. Third, PAGE engages directly with institutional procurement directors to reduce systemic barriers that inadvertently exclude small, local businesses from competitive opportunities.

One of PAGE's most innovative programs is the Hurdle Fund, which provides rapid grants to help diverse firms overcome the small obstacles that often prevent them from winning or maintaining institutional contracts. These "hurdles" might include insurance requirements, equipment purchases, certifications, or other low cost items that nonetheless represent insurmountable barriers for businesses operating on tight margins. The PAGE Capital program has deployed over $237,000 in catalytic grants, unlocking twenty six contracts with local anchors and over $3.2 million in contract revenue for thirteen minority owned businesses [Healthcareanchor](https://anchorcollaboratives.healthcareanchor.network/understanding-anchor-strategies).

## Who Will Be in the Room: The Institutional Power Players

The February 26 event at the [Alan Horwitz "Sixth Man" Center](https://www.phillyyouthbasketball.org/sixthmancenter) brings together procurement professionals from institutions whose purchasing decisions shape Philadelphia's economic landscape. The confirmed institutional participants include the University of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, the Office of Transportation & Infrastructure Systems, Montgomery County, Community College of Philadelphia, Temple University, and the University of Delaware.

These organizations represent distinct procurement opportunities across multiple sectors. The City of Philadelphia's procurement processes govern everything from construction contracts to professional services to technology implementations. The Office of Transportation & Infrastructure Systems oversees projects related to Philadelphia's roads, bridges, transit systems, and public infrastructure. Universities purchase everything from research equipment to food services to maintenance contracts. Community colleges need training equipment, educational technology, and facility management services.

Understanding the specific procurement needs and processes of each institution becomes crucial for businesses seeking to establish ongoing vendor relationships rather than one time contracts. PAGE facilitates this understanding through data analysis, direct consultation with procurement professionals, and systematic mapping of contract opportunities against local business capabilities.

## The Venue: Alan Horwitz "Sixth Man" Center

The choice of venue for this year's summit carries symbolic significance beyond mere logistics. The 100,000 square foot Alan Horwitz "Sixth Man" Center is a world class facility designed to provide a safe space for youth, caregivers, and community members to access basketball and non basketball programming and resources [PYB](https://www.phillyyouthbasketball.org/sixthmancenter). Located in Philadelphia's Nicetown neighborhood, the center represents the kind of community investment that anchor institutions increasingly support through their economic development strategies.

The facility, which was opened after raising more than $40 million to purchase and fully renovate [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/alan-horwitz-sixth-man-center-philadelphia/), embodies the intersection of sports, youth development, and community building that characterizes successful neighborhood revitalization efforts. For a summit focused on inclusive economic growth, hosting the event at a facility dedicated to serving Philadelphia's youth creates a direct connection between procurement practices and community impact.

## Corporate Sponsorship and Regional Investment

The summit's corporate sponsors include JPMorgan Chase, TD Bank, Independence Blue Cross, Pride Enterprises, Bellwether District, Turner Construction, and Mishka Vodka. These organizations represent different aspects of Philadelphia's business ecosystem, from major financial institutions to construction firms to local enterprises.

JPMorgan Chase's involvement reflects the bank's broader commitment to Philadelphia's economic development. JPMorgan Chase announced that it will not only add new retail branches, but will also invest $3 billion in mortgage and small business lending in the region over five years [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/newsroom/stories/jpmc-invests-in-philly-what-it-means). The bank's Community Development Banking efforts have invested more than $260 million in Philadelphia community development organizations committed to creating a city where everyone can thrive [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/real-estate/community-development-banking/community-development-banking-investing-in-philadelphia).

Turner Construction's sponsorship highlights the construction industry's recognition that supplier diversity programs benefit both institutional buyers and local contractors. [Turner Construction](https://www.turnerconstruction.com/) has been involved in numerous major Philadelphia projects, and their participation in the PAGE Summit demonstrates industry leadership in creating pathways for diverse construction firms to access large scale projects.

## The Follow Up Imperative: From Conversation to Contract

Harry Hayman's emphasis on showing up prepared, bringing business cards, and following up quickly reflects an understanding that networking events only generate value when participants actively convert conversations into ongoing relationships. The PAGE Summit creates the initial connection, but the real work happens in the days and weeks following the event.

Successful suppliers understand that winning institutional contracts requires demonstrating not just competitive pricing but also reliability, capacity, and alignment with institutional values around quality, compliance, and community benefit. The summit provides an opportunity to communicate these capabilities directly to decision makers, but converting that conversation into a contract requires systematic follow up, responsiveness to procurement requirements, and often participation in formal vendor registration and certification processes.

PAGE supports this follow up process through its network of business advisory services, technical assistance providers, and capital access resources. Rather than leaving businesses to navigate institutional procurement systems alone, the collaborative provides guidance on everything from insurance requirements to bonding capacity to cash flow management during contract fulfillment.

## Procurement as Economic Development Strategy

The broader context for understanding the PAGE Summit involves recognizing how procurement strategies have evolved from compliance focused supplier diversity programs to strategic economic development initiatives. Between 1996 and 2003, the University of Pennsylvania tripled the dollar amount of goods and services purchased from West Philadelphia businesses through their Economic Inclusion Initiative [ICIC](https://icic.org/blog/role-anchor-institutions-supporting-local-communities/), demonstrating how intentional local purchasing can transform neighborhood business ecosystems.

Research from the [Initiative for a Competitive Inner City](https://icic.org/blog/role-anchor-institutions-supporting-local-communities/) suggests that local procurement supports locally owned businesses, which are more likely to be owned by and employ minorities and women [ICIC](https://icic.org/blog/role-anchor-institutions-supporting-local-communities/). This creates a multiplier effect where procurement dollars not only support individual businesses but also contribute to broader wealth building and economic inclusion within communities that have historically faced barriers to accessing institutional contract opportunities.

The economic impact extends beyond direct contract revenue. Businesses that successfully establish vendor relationships with anchor institutions gain credibility that helps them access other opportunities, secure financing on better terms, and attract talent. The stability of institutional contracts also enables business owners to make strategic investments in equipment, technology, and workforce development that position them for continued growth.

## Philadelphia's 2026 Context: America's 250th Anniversary

The timing of the 7th Annual PAGE Summit occurs within Philadelphia's broader preparation for hosting major events throughout 2026 as the nation marks its 250th anniversary. The city will welcome visitors from around the world for celebrations, commemorations, and cultural programming throughout the year. This context creates additional opportunities for local businesses to position themselves as providers of goods and services to institutions managing increased visitation, event programming, and international engagement.

For businesses in sectors like hospitality, event management, catering, transportation, security, and cultural programming, the institutional connections made at the PAGE Summit could translate into contracts related to 2026 programming and events. Understanding how anchor institutions plan to participate in [America's 250th anniversary](https://www.visitphilly.com/articles/philadelphia/events-festivals-2026/) celebrations provides strategic insight into where procurement opportunities might emerge over the coming months.

## Recommendations for Attendees: Maximizing Summit Value

For entrepreneurs and business owners planning to attend the February 26 summit, preparation makes the difference between collecting business cards and establishing genuine relationships with institutional procurement professionals. Research the participating anchor institutions in advance, understanding their organizational priorities, recent initiatives, and stated commitments around supplier diversity and local purchasing.

Bring materials that clearly communicate your business capabilities, past performance, relevant certifications, and capacity to fulfill institutional contracts. Be prepared to discuss not just what your business does but how your capabilities align with institutional needs and values. Procurement professionals evaluate potential vendors on multiple dimensions beyond price, including reliability, quality, compliance with regulations, and alignment with institutional missions.

Listen carefully during conversations with institutional representatives. Ask questions about procurement processes, vendor registration requirements, upcoming contracting opportunities, and preferred methods for staying informed about future opportunities. Taking notes during these conversations demonstrates professionalism and provides the information needed for effective follow up.

After the event, follow up promptly with every meaningful contact made during the summit. Send personalized emails referencing specific conversation points, attach relevant business information, and express genuine interest in exploring vendor relationships. For contacts who mentioned specific upcoming opportunities, ask about appropriate next steps for expressing formal interest or submitting proposals.

## The Broader Anchor Institution Movement

Philadelphia's PAGE initiative represents one node in a national network of anchor institution collaboratives working to leverage institutional purchasing power for community economic development. Similar initiatives exist in [Cleveland](https://case.fyi/), [Baltimore](https://www.bniajfi.org/), [Chicago](https://www.westsideunited.org/), and other cities, each adapted to local economic conditions, institutional structures, and community priorities.

The [Healthcare Anchor Network](https://healthcareanchor.network/) provides research, tools, and peer learning opportunities for hospitals and health systems pursuing anchor strategies. The [Democracy Collaborative](https://democracycollaborative.org/) has documented best practices in anchor institution engagement and community wealth building. These national resources inform local initiatives like PAGE and help accelerate learning across cities working to harness institutional economic power for inclusive growth.

## Conclusion: Opportunity Meets Action

Harry Hayman's message about the PAGE Summit captures an essential truth about economic opportunity: it doesn't materialize through passive observation or wishful thinking. It emerges when preparation meets opportunity, when institutional commitment meets entrepreneurial capability, and when conversations convert into contracts through diligent follow up and professional execution.

The February 26 event at the Alan Horwitz "Sixth Man" Center offers Philadelphia entrepreneurs direct access to the procurement professionals who control billions of dollars in annual institutional spending. For businesses ready to scale, diversify their client base, or navigate the complexities of institutional purchasing, the summit provides not just information but actual relationship building with decision makers whose choices shape regional economic patterns.

The broader PAGE initiative demonstrates how collaborative approaches to procurement can create systemic change that benefits both institutions and communities. By addressing policy barriers, providing technical assistance and capital access, and creating accountability frameworks for measuring progress, PAGE moves beyond rhetoric about inclusive growth to concrete implementation of procurement practices that build community wealth.

For Harry Hayman and other Philadelphia business leaders, civic advocates, and cultural practitioners, the PAGE Summit represents an opportunity to witness and participate in the transformation of institutional purchasing from a transactional function into a strategic tool for advancing equity and inclusion. The conversations that unfold on February 26 have the potential to alter business trajectories, create employment opportunities, and strengthen the fabric of Philadelphia's business ecosystem in ways that extend far beyond a single contract or vendor relationship.

Show up ready. Bring cards. Follow up fast. In Philadelphia's anchor institution economy, opportunity rewards those who meet institutional commitments with entrepreneurial excellence and convert networking moments into lasting business relationships. The 7th Annual PAGE Summit creates the space for these transformative connections; what happens next depends on the preparation, professionalism, and persistence that attendees bring to the opportunity before them.
