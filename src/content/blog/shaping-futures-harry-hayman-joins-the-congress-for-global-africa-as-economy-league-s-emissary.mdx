When **Harry Hayman** stepped into the ballroom at the Congress for Global Africa’s *Shaping the Future* conference, he entered more than a gathering—he entered a moment in history. Invited to represent the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia, Hayman stood among a formidable assembly: leaders and changemakers from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Mid-Atlantic region, all converging to blueprint not just ideas but agreements, policies, and partnerships.

## The Stakes Are Real: Why This Conference Matters

The 14th Annual Pan African Global Trade & Investment Conference, convened by the Center for Global Africa under the banner *“Shaping the Future: Connecting Markets & Building Prosperity,”* offered more than a platform for optimism; it pledged accountability, action, and cross-border investment.\

Over four days in September 2025, more than 100 participants—including public officials, business leaders, diaspora entrepreneurs, and academic voices—came together to explore how to more deeply link U.S. economic nodes (especially in Delaware and the Mid-Atlantic) with the vast potential of African and Caribbean markets.

This matters not just for diplomacy or optics, but for everyday people: traders, farmers, small manufacturers, tech startups, creative producers, and communities impacted by supply chains, food systems, and health infrastructure.

## In the Room Where Vision Meets Execution

For Hayman, being in that room was about more than representation—it was about translating Philadelphia’s civic ambitions into global relevance. He listened to panels on:

* **Agribusiness & Food Sovereignty** — building resilient food systems in Africa and beyond
* **Supply Chain Resilience** — reimagining logistics, local manufacturing, and regional corridors
* **Global Health & Innovation** — ensuring equitable access in post-pandemic worlds
* **Creative Industries & AI** — youth, culture, film, and music serving as engines of growth
* **Trade, Investment & Diaspora Engagement** — deals that animate capital flows and meaningful partnerships

Every breakout session, workshop, and networking round carried a throughline: *this is not talk for talk’s sake*. The ambition was to emerge with memoranda, MOUs, and pilot programs that land in communities.

## The Economy League Wears the Jersey Proudly
