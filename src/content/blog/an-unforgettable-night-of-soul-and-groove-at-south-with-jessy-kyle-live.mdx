Philadelphia came alive this weekend as SOUTH Restaurant & Jazz Club hosted an unforgettable evening with the incomparable Jessy Kyle. Known for her powerhouse vocals and magnetic stage presence, Jessy delivered two electrifying sets that reminded everyone in attendance why live music is so essential. Every note, every phrase, and every groove resonated with the kind of energy that only a performer of her caliber can bring.

She was accompanied by a phenomenal band whose chemistry and talent elevated the night to another level. Louis Rieger on bass, Ian Sadock on keys, Marc Dryburgh on drums, and Mike Burton on horns created a sonic landscape that was both intricate and infectious. Together, they offered a masterclass in soul, jazz, and Philly groove that left the audience on their feet and fully immersed in the experience.

Harry Hayman, who attended the show, noted how the room felt alive from start to finish. SOUTH became more than a venue; it became a space where music, passion, and community collided. Guests swayed, cheered, and connected over every song, turning a night of performance into a shared memory.

The evening was a powerful reminder of the talent, heart, and creativity thriving in Philadelphia’s music scene. Huge gratitude went out to Jessy Kyle and her band for creating a night full of magic, music, and memories that will linger long after the last note faded.
