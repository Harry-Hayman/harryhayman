This past weekend, Sea Isle City felt like a five-star exhale. The sun melted into the bay, the ocean rolled in like warm silk, and I found myself posted up with Michael Singer’s *Untethered Soul*—a book that feels like a field guide to telling my brain’s noisy roommate to take a long walk on the pier.

The soundtrack was perfect: waves clapping in rhythm, gulls gossiping in the breeze, and pages turning in my hands. With every chapter, it felt less like reading and more like remembering how to breathe. Heart opening, soul untethering.

There’s something about that mix—sunset, saltwater, and stillness—that makes you forget the world’s pace and remember your own.

10/10 would recommend. If peace had a zip code, I’m convinced it would be 08243.
