Documentary filmmaking is often romanticized as a world of cinematic magic, creative breakthroughs, and inspirational storytelling. But ask anyone who has actually built a documentary from scratch, and they will tell you: it is messy, relentless, and demands everything you have. I know this firsthand because I’m Harry Hayman, and I am leading the creation of a documentary that dives deep into the realities of food insecurity in Philadelphia and across America.

If you’ve ever wondered what it takes to make a documentary that truly matters, here’s a glimpse behind the curtain from one of our I AM HUNGRY in Philadelphia planning sessions. This was just ONE hour of discussion, but it captures the intensity, the energy, and the commitment required.

## Director Updates

Our director is in the thick of learning how to sync sound and video, a technical task that, while invisible on screen, is critical to delivering a polished, professional film. Every sound effect, every interview, every street scene relies on precision.

## Producer Updates

The producer team is unstoppable. From tracking interviews with everyone from the Governor to the Mayor to public figures like Isaiah Thomas, no lead is too big, no connection too small. Every interaction shapes the story we are telling.

## Capturing Real Lives

We spend hours strategizing how to document the lived experience of people facing food insecurity. This means filming candidly on the streets, exploring conversations about SNAP benefits, dignity, and survival, and ensuring we handle each story with respect and honesty.

## Creative Decisions

From debating animation styles to locking in a host, from brainstorming a cinematic vocabulary that includes words like “recipes” to reviewing other documentaries and reference books, creativity intersects with strategy at every turn. The goal is not only to inform but to resonate on a human level.

## Funding and Partnerships

Documentaries do not fund themselves. We work on grants, sponsorships, and financing plans while collaborating with researchers, policymakers, advocates, and a dedicated Task Force. We even meet with the White House’s national nutrition strategy team to encourage meaningful action.

## Soundtrack and Distribution

The film’s emotional impact is amplified through music, carefully curated to support storytelling without overshadowing it. Meanwhile, we are constantly discussing distribution: festival deadlines, museum screenings, panel conversations, and strategies to reach the widest possible audience.

## Whyy It Matters

This is where the mission drives us forward. Food is a human right. The people living the reality of hunger deserve a film worthy of their truth. We are not taking shortcuts. Every interview, every scene, every decision is made with honesty and humanity at its core.

Creating a documentary is a test of endurance, creativity, and resolve. It requires pouring your heart and energy into every element, knowing that the final product will have the power to educate, inspire, and create change.

So whyy does this matter to Harry Hayman? Because documenting hunger is not just about making a film, it is about building understanding, sparking action, and honoring the lived experiences of those too often overlooked. This documentary is a commitment to truth, and a testament to the belief that storytelling can change the world.

Stay tuned. We are far from finished, but what we are building is powerful, necessary, and transformative.
