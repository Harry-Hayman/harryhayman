Friday night at SOUTH Jazz Kitchen was one for the books. The kind of night where every note, every breath, and every beat reminded the audience why Philly’s music scene is second to none.

Carol Riddick took the stage first, and from the moment she opened her mouth, the room was spellbound. Her voice — rich, smooth, and filled with emotion — wrapped around each lyric like velvet and fire all at once. Every song felt like a story, every note carried the heartbeat of Philly soul.

Then came Gerald Veasley. With his bass in hand and that unmistakable presence, he didn’t just play — he led. His groove was deep, precise, and full of passion, the kind that hits straight in the chest. Veasley doesn’t just perform music; he tells stories through sound.

The band behind them made the night complete. Chris Farr on sax cut through the air like silver lightning, Donald Robinson commanded the keys with soulful authority, Timmy Hutson kept the rhythm grounded and alive, and Pablo Batista added the heartbeat of percussion — vibrant, spiritual, and unstoppable.

It was more than a concert. It was communion. Philly came together in one room to celebrate what this city has always done best — live music that moves the soul.

By the end of the night, the crowd was on its feet, shouting for more. Because when Carol Riddick and Gerald Veasley share a stage, it’s not just a show — it’s an experience that reminds everyone why we love this city and its sound.
