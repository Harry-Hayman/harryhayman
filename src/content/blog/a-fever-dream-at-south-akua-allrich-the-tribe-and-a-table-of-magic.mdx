There are nights in Philadelphia that do not just pass, they live in you. This past weekend was one of those rare stretches, when SOUTH Jazz Kitchen became less of a venue and more of a spell. The lights glowed warm, the groove snapped like it had teeth, and Akua Allrich & The Tribe pulled Saturday and Sunday into the kind of fever dream you do not want to wake from.

Akua Allrich is not just a vocalist. She is a force that moves through registers and emotions with equal ease. Her voice draped the room in silk but never let go of its spine. She does not just sing notes, she tells stories, and each phrase had the weight of a memory you suddenly realize is yours. When she speaks to the crowd between songs, there is a kind of easy command, the sense that you are in the hands of someone who knows exactly where she is taking you and delights in showing you the scenery along the way.

The Tribe matched her fire step for step. Luke, Wayne, and Kris delivered the kind of grooves that make your neck sore the next morning. And then there was Arnetta “That Trumpet Chic(k)” Johnson. If her name has been floating around your radar, believe the hype. NPR flagged her as an Artist to Watch, and seeing her live made the label feel like understatement. Her trumpet tone shot clean and laser-bright, yet it carried heat like Camden streets and polish from her Berklee training. The phrasing? Precise enough to stop time, playful enough to make you laugh mid-phrase. Every solo she played felt like a new chapter, written in real time and impossible to forget.

But let us be honest. SOUTH is never just about the music. The menu is a co-star, and this weekend it shared equal billing with the band.

* **Watermelon & Heirloom Tomato Salad**: lush cubes of melon, slices of heirloom tomato, whipped honey goat cheese, and a drizzle of mint oil that lifted everything into the realm of refreshment. It was the edible definition of summer.
* **Caribbean Curry Pasta**: this one deserves a standing ovation of its own. Spicy grilled chicken, sautéed shrimp, charred heirloom tomatoes, and a sauce that took the word curry, spun it through the Caribbean, and handed it back as something soulful, spicy, and entirely addictive. If you go, ask your server about it.
* **Warm Double Chocolate Brownie Tower**: when a dessert arrives stacked like an exclamation point, you know it means business. The brownie was rich, the powdered sugar fell like new snow, and the vanilla bean ice cream melted into rivulets that cut the chocolate with perfect timing. It was indulgence without apology.

The magic was on stage. The mischief was on the palate. The room itself buzzed with a kind of electricity you cannot fake. Neighbors at nearby tables leaned in like family, forks traded hands, and for a couple of hours South Broad felt like the center of a universe built out of rhythm, flavor, and community.

SOUTH continues to remind us why it is one of the anchors of Philadelphia’s jazz scene. It is not just the bookings, though they are consistently top tier. It is the way the space frames sound and taste together, turning every show into a memory layered with music and flavor.

As I left into the Philly night, the last notes of trumpet still ringing in my ears and the taste of chocolate still lingering on my tongue, I realized something simple. Nights like these are why we go out. Nights like these are why jazz still matters. Nights like these are why SOUTH is more than a venue.

Magic on stage. Mischief on the palate. Until the next one.
