The Weekend is going to be beautiful; please consider supporting my friend Avram Hornik as he opens his new place. @walnutphl

The Walnut Garden officially opens today at 4 pm. This Summer, Walnut Garden is coming in hot as the newest family-friendly cocktail garden in the heart of Rittenhouse, Philadelphia.

FCM Hospitality is igniting the 1700 block of Walnut Street with sizzling and vibrant energy, transforming a former fire-ravaged site into a must-visit destination.
