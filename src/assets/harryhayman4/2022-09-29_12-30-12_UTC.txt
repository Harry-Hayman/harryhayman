So proud and humbled to be present at the retirement of a truly remarkable lady, Regina Austin, a Professor at The University of Pennsylvania.⁣
⁣
Professor Austin’s scholarship focuses on the impact of law on cultural conflicts arising largely from race, gender, and class inequality, as most often revealed by the critical analysis of ethnographies and law-genre documentary films and photography.⁣
⁣
We need more like her! Congratulations on your retirement, and thank you for your years of service!⁣
