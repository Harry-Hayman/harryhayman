Amazing Event Alert! The Philadelphia School District's Family Math Fall Festival! 

This weekend, I was honored to attend the Family Math Fall Festival at Temple University's Ritter Hall! This wasn’t just an event—it was a movement, a game-changer, and a powerful reminder of how vital education is to Philadelphia's future.

The atmosphere was electric, from interactive math games that had kids excitedly embracing numbers, to hands-on estimation challenges and fun financial literacy activities. The joy and curiosity I saw on each child's face confirmed it: math can be fun, empowering, and truly transformative!

And it’s not just about math; events like these represent something much larger. Education is the foundation of a strong, thriving city. Along with the crucial work to address food insecurity, supporting educational experiences like this is at the very top of my personal list for building a better Philadelphia.

A huge shoutout to the School District of Philadelphia and the amazing organizations that made this possible, including Imagine Learning, Fox Chase Farm, TGR Foundation, WHYY, and so many more. 

This event was more than a festival; it was a commitment to our children’s futures and a bold statement that Philadelphia is dedicated to creating a community where everyone—especially our youngest citizens—has the tools and opportunities to succeed.

Let’s keep the momentum going, Philly! Together, we can ensure every child gets access to the resources, knowledge, and support they need to succeed. #FamilyMathFallFestival #EducationMatters #FutureOfPhiladelphia #PhillyStrong #MathIsFun
