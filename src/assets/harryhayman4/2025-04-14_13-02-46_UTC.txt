IT WAS A MASTERCLASS IN MISSION, MEALS & MAGIC.**

I had the honor of attending MANNA’s 4th Annual CHEF Radio LIVE at The Rittenhouse and let me tell you... the vibes...food...purpose...what else can you ask for? 
From the moment you walked in, it was clear: this wasn’t just another food event — this was a celebration of impact, taste, and community wrapped in five-star flavor.

Sue Daugherty,, the unstoppable force behind MANNA, continues to raise the bar for what food can do. She’s proof that leadership + heart = transformation.

Eli Kulp held court like only he can — brilliant, curious, generous. CHEF Radio LIVE continues to be THE platform where food meets philosophy.

Ran into Philly jazz icon Elliot Levin, still blowing minds and bending notes with that signature soul all these years later (not going to tell you where we met...okay...you twisted my arm...Bacchanal back in the day!). A legend in every way.
And of course, the master of buzz and storytelling himself, Peter Breslow, was in the house (he's everywhere!) — reminding everyone how to elevate a room just by walking in.

With a chef lineup curated by Eli and the incredible Ange Branca (@angepmyb of @kamparphilly — and 2025 James Beard Semifinalist, no big deal ), the flavors hit hard and the purpose hit harder.

MANNA is doing the real work: delivering medically tailored meals and nutrition counseling to those battling critical illness — over a million meals a year! - food as medicine, food as dignity, food as hope.

If you weren’t there, you missed something special. But it’s never too late to support. Get involved, donate, show up.

Because what they’re doing? That’s the kind of Philly I want to be part of.
