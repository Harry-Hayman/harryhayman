WOW. Just WOW. 

I got a chance to attend the Philadelphia Committee on City Policy (PCCP) luncheon featuring Bill Marrazzo, President & CEO of WHYY.

Under Bill’s visionary leadership, WHYY has become a national powerhouse in public broadcasting and a civic anchor here in Philly—producing icons like Fresh Air with Terry Gross while amplifying grassroots stories through platforms like Billy Penn and PlanPhilly.

But what truly elevated the conversation? The ever-brilliant Andy Toy—moderating with depth, grace, and the kind of insight that only comes from someone who's lived and breathed community policy for decades. Andy’s presence and thoughtful facilitation brought it all together.

Huge thanks to Maurice Goodman and the PCCP team for the invite. Events like this are why civic dialogue matters—they remind us of the power of public service, trusted media, and engaged leadership to shape the future of Philadelphia.

If you care about this city, you need to be in rooms like this. I left fired up, full of ideas, and more hopeful than ever about what’s possible when public institutions and community leaders align.
