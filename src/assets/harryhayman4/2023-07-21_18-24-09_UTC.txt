Happy to be a fly on the wall at the meeting of two powerful entities – Christa Barfield of @farmerjawn and Rakia Reynolds @rakiareynolds of Skai Blue Media @skaibluemedia at the beautiful SOUTH RESTAURANT & JAZZ CLUB– it reminded me of The Law of Action & Reaction from Physics (see Dr. Donner, I was paying attention!) @southjazzkitchen⁣
⁣
The Law of Action-Reaction (Revisited) Newton's third law of motion and the conservation of momentum, particularly in the context of collisions and explosions within isolated systems. Newton's third law explains that every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force, while the conservation of momentum principle asserts that the total momentum remains constant in a closed system unless acted upon by an external force. Through these principles, we can analyze the dynamics of collisions where equal and opposite forces are applied and explosions where an object at rest disperses into fragments while preserving total momentum.⁣
