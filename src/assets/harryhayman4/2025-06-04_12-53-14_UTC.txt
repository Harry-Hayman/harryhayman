Feeling incredibly honored and proud to have been part of the Community Health Builders Program alongside such passionate and dedicated leaders.

Grateful for the opportunity to connect with the community and contribute to conversations that matter — food, health, and building a stronger, healthier future for all.

A huge thank you to everyone who made the culminating event so impactful — 100% of attendees said it helped them better understand the power of food and health. 

Excited to stay connected with this amazing network and to keep pushing the work forward. Let’s keep building! #CommunityHealth #FoodIsMedicine #Gratitude #StrongerTogether
