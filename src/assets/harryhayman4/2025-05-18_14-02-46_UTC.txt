🚨 Big things happening in Philly! 🚨

I’m excited to share that I’ll be at the Fair City Challenge Pitch Competition on Wednesday, May 21st — and you should be too.

This event is all about real solutions for revaluing properties in historically disinvested neighborhoods across Philadelphia. Over a dozen teams will be pitching bold, creative ideas — and up to 5 of them will win $10K and a spot in the Fair City Accelerator!

It’s going to be a powerful night of innovation, community, and celebration — hosted by the incredible Dr. Kyle The Conductor, with DJ Ron Jeez spinning live music, and yes… wine + good vibes included 🍷🎶

🗓 May 21, 2025
🕔 5PM
📍 Center for Architecture & Design – 1218 Arch St, Philly
🎟 Tickets: https://f.mtr.cool/islkzcukdw

Let’s show up, support, and uplift the future of Philly. If you care about this city, this is one night you don’t want to miss.
