Such an amazing night at Fork @forkrestaurant last night thanks to Visit Philly @visitphilly (shout out to Angela Val and her whole team for this event and all she is doing for the City), and congratulations to Ellen, Chad, and all the winners...good to see Eli Kulp from @highstreethospitality Christa Barfield from FarmerJawn @farmerjawn Larry Downey from @broadstreetmin just to name a few...

So everybody knows what is going on, Philly won big at this year's James Beard Awards: At a red-carpet ceremony in Chicago last night, a whopping three chefs and restaurants from Philly won James Beard Awards, considered one of the food industry’s highest honors, akin to the Oscars. 

The James Beard Foundation is a nonprofit organization with a mission to celebrate, support, and elevate the people behind America’s food culture and champion a standard of good food anchored in talent, equity, and sustainability. @beardfoundation
