Today I am reminded of the powerful words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: 

'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' 

Dr. King's message feels just as powerful and relevant today. It's a reminder for all of us to keep pushing for fairness and equality in our corners of the world. Let's honor his legacy by being the light in the darkness he spoke of.
