After 20 years without a solid working space, the Philabundance Community Kitchen (PCK) has finally found a home at 2224 N. 10th Street in North Philadelphia just in time for our 20th anniversary. PCK is a 16-week culinary training and life skills program providing opportunities to adults with little to no income who need not just a job, but a second chance at life (https://www.philabundance.org/pck/)
