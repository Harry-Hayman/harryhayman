🎷Mark your calendars, Philly!

On Thursday, June 19, I’ll be celebrating Juneteenth and Black Music Month at Resonance: A Black Music Month Soirée — and I’d love for you to join me.

Hosted by Jazz Bridge, this elegant evening at SouthSide is all about soul, sound, and community. Expect a powerful night filled with:

🎶 Live jazz from the Byron Landham Trio
🍷 Open bar (yes, wine + beer!)
🥂 Delicious bites
🤝 Deep connection + purpose

All proceeds go to support Jazz Bridge’s incredible work helping local jazz and blues musicians in crisis. Let’s celebrate the legacy of Black music while giving back to the artists who make it all possible.

📍 SouthSide | 600 N Broad St
🕔 Doors at 5PM | Event starts at 6PM
🎟 Don’t miss it — secure your spot now!
