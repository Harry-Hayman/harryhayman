When people ask how they can get involved with our food crisis, I tell them this.

There are many hardworking organizations and teams in our city who are fighting a problem that will take years of innovation and support. 

What we need right now need is donations and help getting food to people who need it.

This is a band-aid solution, while we also work on sustainable innovations for growing enough food to feed everyone.

If you want to join us on this mission, you can start today with:

@philabundance 
@sharefoodphilly 
@mannanourishes 
@thefoodtrust 
@broadstreetmin 

Thank you all for the help and consideration for joining this fight. 

There are real people whose lives are changed for the better through these organizations.
