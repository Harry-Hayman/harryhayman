BIG NEWS, PHILLY 

This weekend, I'm pulling up to support Muhammad Abdul-Hadi and the local Philadelphia food economy— at the soft launch of Out West Café ☕🔥.

If you know anything about Muhammad, you already know this is not just another coffee shop. This is community. This is culture. This is coffee with a mission. And this weekend is just the beginning.

You’ve supported Down North Pizza (if you haven’t, we need to talk). Now it’s time to show love again as Muhammad brings that same energy — uplifting the community, creating opportunities, and serving up excellence — with Out West.

👉🏾 Where: Out West Café
👉🏾 When: This weekend — don’t play yourself, show up early
👉🏾 Why: Because this is what investing in us looks like.

I’ll be there — come get a cup, dap up a visionary, and say you were there from day one when Philly's next great space for connection was born. Let’s pack the house and pour all the love into this launch.

📍2804 W Lehigh Ave, Philly — Pull up!
