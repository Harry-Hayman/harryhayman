SOUTH is on 🔥 This Weekend!
This weekend, SOUTH is the place to be! 

We’re turning up the heat with a double dose of incredible talent:

Alison Crockett 
Dubbed the “Queen of Nu Jazz,” Alison’s voice is a soulful force of nature. Her captivating performances are a poetic blend of jazz, soul, and R&B that will take you on a journey you’ll never want to end. If you haven’t experienced her magic live, now’s your chance to be utterly mesmerized.
Jon Michel 
Bass virtuoso and Philly’s jazz royalty, Jon Michel is the heartbeat of every stage he graces. His smooth grooves and masterful musicianship set the perfect rhythm for an unforgettable night. Come feel the energy he brings to SOUTH’s stage!

While you’re soaking up the music, don’t miss out on our craft cocktails. Called one of “Philly’s Best Cocktail Bars” by The Inquirer, we’re serving up excellence in every glass. This weekend, I'm recommending the Bourbon Strawberry Jam—a cocktail that’s as sweet as the melodies and just as unforgettable.

And let’s not forget the food. Our Southern-inspired dishes are to die for, paired with warm, welcoming service and an atmosphere that’s just as rich as the music.

Music, cocktails, food, and vibes—this weekend at SOUTH is pure magic. Don’t miss it. Bring your friends, your appetite, and your love for great music. 

Reserve your spot now (if you can)!
