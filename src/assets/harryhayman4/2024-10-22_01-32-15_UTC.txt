Dineround Time at GPLEX!  A Night of Food, Wine, and Meaningful Dialogue!

Our GPLEX journey took a flavorful turn as we gathered for a memorable dineround conversation at the stunning Callie Restaurant in San Diego! ðŸŒŸ From the moment we walked in, we were treated to an unforgettable evening of incredible food, expertly crafted cocktails, and an exceptional wine selectionâ€”all paired with deep, thought-provoking conversations.

A heartfelt THANK YOU to Guy Generals from CCP for being such a gracious host and sponsor of this incredible evening. Your support made this intimate gathering possible and truly special.

The conversation flowed as easily as the wine, covering everything from innovation to leadership to the power of community. It was a reminder that, while food and drink nourish the body, meaningful dialogue nourishes the soul.

Thank you to everyone who joined us for an evening of connection, laughter, and inspiration.
