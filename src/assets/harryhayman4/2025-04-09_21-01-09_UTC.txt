IT WAS A SPIRITUAL AWAKENING. 
Still floating after witnessing Nubya Garcia melt time, space, and sanity at Ardmore Music Hall.
Nubya didn’t just perform—she summoned.
From cosmic saxophone screams to rhythm patterns that rewired our DNA, this was jazz as revolution, healing, and prophecy. Her set? A cross-Atlantic journey through Caribbean roots, London grit, and celestial serenity.
Her presence? Regal. Radiant. Ruthless.
Her band? Every note was a masterclass in restraint, release, and raw expression - the drummer was killing it!

And let’s talk about the opener:

Magi Merlin. A genre-fluid firestarter. Neo-soul, trip-hop, and future funk melted into something that felt like Erykah Badu and Portishead had a baby raised by FKA twigs. The crowd? Transfixed.
If you're sleeping on Nubya’s Odyssey, wake the hell up.
If you haven’t seen her live, change your plans, your life, your religion.
If you believe in the future of jazz, Nubya is the future. And it's glorious.

Shoutout to @ArdmoreMusic for hosting a night that reminded us:
Jazz is alive. Jazz is global. Jazz is NOW.
