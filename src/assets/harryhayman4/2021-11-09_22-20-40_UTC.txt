I & my 501 C 3s The Feed Philly Coalition would like to share that the Commerce Department has agreed to open up the Sustainability Tax Credit to restaurants, and include food rescue/diversion as one of the "sustainable" options to encourage restaurants to upcycle their food (and get a $4000 BURT Tax Credit as a result). The organizations will announce legislation to help restaurants via Facebook Live on Tuesday November 16th at 6 PM.
