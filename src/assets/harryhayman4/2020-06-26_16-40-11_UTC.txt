Do you know what I did this week? I bought a pair of sneakers, and planted a pair of trees. Okay, not personally, but Cariuma will! This Brazilian based shoe company started their own restoration program where they plant two trees in the Brazilian Rainforest for every pair of sneakers sold. Check them out! Their sneakers are made with such high-quality — trust me, it’s worth every dollar.
