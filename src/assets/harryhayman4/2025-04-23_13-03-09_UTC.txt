SOUTH Still Swings Supreme 
I know, I know… I sound like a broken record (pun proudly intended).
But when the jazz is this special, ambiance and service this divine, the food this soul-satisfying, and the vibe this unmatched — how can I not sing SOUTH’s praises?

Enter: G. Thomas Allen.
This man doesn’t just sing — he elevates.
Grammy-winning, velvet-voiced, and blessed with phrasing that dances between devotion and defiance — G. Thomas turned the stage into sacred ground this weekend.
Each note? Precision.
Each pause? A sermon.
Each encore? Earned.

And let’s not forget the sermon coming from the kitchen:
Sazeracs that sip like New Orleans in a glass
Chargrilled oysters kissed by smoke and spice
(Vegan!) jambalaya with all the depth, none of the guilt
Sweet potato cheesecake — as sinful as it is Southern

At SOUTH, it’s never just dinner and a show.
It’s culture plated and performed.
A full-body, full-soul reminder that jazz — and joy — still live here in Philly.

If you know, you’re probably still glowing.
If you don’t… well, now you do.
