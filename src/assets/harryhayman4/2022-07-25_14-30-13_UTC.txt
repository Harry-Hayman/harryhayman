2022 is a big year for me! I’m constantly working on learning more so that I can improve my skills with social impact. It took a lot of studying, concentration, and dedication to obtain my Master of Business Administration (MBA), Social Entrepreneurship Major, Magna Cum Laude 2022, at Temple University, Fox School of Business. Here are a few of the projects that I’m passionate about, and working to ensure that they happen:⁣
Create, finance, and drive charitable, philanthropic endeavors as a passionate humanitarian change agent to benefit communities, including combating food insecurities by building public/private partnerships.⁣
Introduced legislation to the City of Philadelphia to encourage businesses to do the right thing by upcycling food and other resources.⁣
Collaborated with the City of Philadelphia Department of Sustainability to track and implement waste reduction strategies.⁣
I’m eager to get started!⁣
If you know any corporations ready to implement these projects, send them my way.
