PSA: DON’T SLEEP ON NORTH 3RD! north3rd 

Last night, I made the long-overdue return to North 3rd Restaurant & Bar, and let me tell you… that was a MISTAKE—not going sooner, that is! 

If you haven’t been lately (or EVER?!), correct that immediately. This place is an absolute vibe—a perfect mix of effortless cool, warm hospitality, and outrageously good food & drinks that remind you why Mark Bee is one of the best to ever do it. 

I hit up Northern Liberties Restaurant Week, and as expected, North 3rd did NOT disappoint. From the impeccable cocktails to dishes that hit every damn note (flavor, texture, presentation—ALL OF IT), it’s clear why this place has been a Philly institution for years.

Lesson learned: I will NOT be waiting this long to come back again. Mark Bee, you crushed it as always! 

GO. MAKE A RESERVATION. THANK ME LATER.
