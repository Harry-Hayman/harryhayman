🎨 Honolulu Museum of Art – A Must-See Experience! 🎭

Had the honor of visiting the Honolulu Museum of Art with my brother—what an incredible place! The highlight? A breathtaking exhibit by Satoru Abe, a legendary artist who created for nearly 100 years.

Ironically, he had just passed the day before our visit, making it even more impactful. If you haven’t seen his work, go check it out! And if you ever get a chance to visit the museum—DO IT! 🎟️✨
