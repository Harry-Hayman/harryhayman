Really enjoying working with my friend Steve Red and his company RTO＋P…such a small world; his brother and I were friends in the 3RD grade at Radnor Middle School⁣
RTO＋P mission is to Become Unforgettable.  Steve Red is PRESIDENT & CO-CHIEF CREATIVE OFFICER. Steve is the founder of Red Tettemer O'Connell ＋ Partners, and he touches everything that goes out of the agency door from a creative and strategic perspective. He believes people are smart and advertising should be too, and that the only real martini is made with gin.⁣
