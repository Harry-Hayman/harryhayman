It was pure magic at InLiquid’s Human Scale opening at Park Towne Place! 
From jaw-dropping architecture-inspired pieces to the stunning, layered histories these brilliant artists unearthed — it was an unforgettable evening. 

An extra special shoutout to my incredible friend and art-world rockstar Rachel Zimmerman — thank you for giving me the inside scoop, introducing me to the artists, and for everything you do for Philadelphia's arts community. Hearing the artists describe their work firsthand added a layer of depth and meaning that you just can’t get anywhere else.

Hats off to Rachel and the entire InLiquid team for curating not just an exhibit, but an experience that celebrates creativity, community, and the vibrant soul of this city.

If you haven’t seen Human Scale yet — you should. This is the kind of art that stays with you long after you leave.
