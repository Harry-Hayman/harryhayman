So excited to join my friends Lori Jones, Kim Hall Jackson, Ben Bynum, and others and the press conference for "Let's Eat!" - will be volunteering w/ them Thursday to help launch the program!⁣

There are still opportunities for you to get involved with a project that helps so many children and families.  Thank you to all that came out to support and continue to aid in making an impact.⁣
