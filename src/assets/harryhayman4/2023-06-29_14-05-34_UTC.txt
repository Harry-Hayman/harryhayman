Greetings – point of parliamentary procedure, thanks to all our friends who reached out to ask me to clarify that yesterday’s post had a logo on the front of the shirt that was actually designed by Chika Okeke (so shout out Chika @Chika_typography)…the back, pictured here, was designed by the Super Poor Kids @thesuperpoorkids 

Just want to get it right/give credit where credit is due. Thanks all…please support ALL live music and follow Philly Soul Now! @phillysoulnow
