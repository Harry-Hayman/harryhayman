How can you help? Time, donations, and dollars. We’ve been doing our party and giving food and financial contributions to support the Rescue Mission, something we’ve been doing for years but never really shared. However, to help serve them with more help, I’m reaching out to all of you. 
The mission relies on the community to help them
Provide shelter to 1,022 men
Serve 44,544 meals
Provide spiritual care to 1,189 men
· Enroll 133 men in transitional and permanent housing 
It takes all of our support to help the Rescue Mission keep serving those in need 365 days a year.
