This weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the 50th Anniversary of Jesus Christ Superstar at the majestic Miller Theater, and what a spectacular show it was!  I distinctly remember the Play Bill hanging in my room as a kid...⁣⁣

The Miller Theater is located at 250 S Broad St, Philadelphia, PA 19102.⁣⁣
 (As of March 2022, The Merriam Theater has been renamed the Miller Theater.)⁣⁣
⁣
Jesus Christ Superstar is a sung-through rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. Loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the Passion, the work interprets the psychology of Jesus and other characters, with much of the plot centered on Judas, who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples. ⁣
⁣
Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock opera's lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events.⁣⁣
