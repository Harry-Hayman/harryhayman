We’ve just announced that the best and brightest stars in the Jazz world are coming to SOUTH to usher in the holiday season - José James and Emmaline.⁣
⁣
So excited to be presenting...Jose James @ SOUTH! Often referred to as a jazz singer for the hip-hop generation, New York City-based vocalist José James combines jazz, soul, drum N bass, and spoken word into his unique brand of vocal jazz. Jose James states his main influences as #JohnColtrane #MarvinGaye, and #BillieHoliday his sound on early 12″ singles and in live performances brought to mind such icons of ’70s jazz-soul as Terry Callier. His music felt more like an update of the fluid crossover approach of Gil Scott-Heron, while also being distinctly his own.⁣
