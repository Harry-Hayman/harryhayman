I'll be wearing orange and attending a "wear Orange" Event this weekend...what about you?

This coming weekend, Be a part of National Gun Violence Awareness Day and Wear Orange Weekend, happening THIS WEEKEND, June 2-4: Find an event near you!

National Gun Violence Awareness Day and Wear Orange Weekend. With more than 120 people shot and killed every day in the United States, as well as hundreds more who are wounded, we will use this moment to demand action and make our voices heard.

Together, we can help build a future free from gun violence. And for ourselves and each other, we can turn grief into hope.
