🌟 Weekend Highlight: Our Culinary Journey to Bastia 🌟

This weekend, we had the distinct pleasure of visiting Bastia, Fishtown's Mediterranean gem, and let us tell you—it’s an experience worth savoring. 🍴✨

A labor of love, Bastia seamlessly supports the local food economy while whisking diners away to the sun-drenched shores of Corsica and Sardinia. It’s no surprise that Esquire named it one of America’s Best New Restaurants—a title it wears proudly and deservedly! 🌊🌞

From the moment we walked in, Manager Kate greeted us with warmth and unparalleled hospitality, setting the tone for a night to remember. Thank you, Kate, for making us feel like family! 💫

The ambiance is a perfect blend of rustic charm and modern elegance, creating a space where you can linger over every bite. The transition from day café to upscale evening dining is seamless, inviting you to relax and indulge. 🍷🕯️

Here’s a taste of what made our night unforgettable:
🥘 Seafood Stew – A rich, aromatic dish that transported us straight to the Mediterranean coast.
🥗 Pearled Couscous Salad – A refreshing mix of flavors, perfectly balanced with a hint of citrus.
🍞 House-Made Flatbreads – Warm, fragrant, and the perfect canvas for their signature spreads.
🍸 Corsican-Inspired Cocktails – A delightful twist on your classic favorites.

Bastia is more than just a restaurant—it’s a celebration of flavors, community, and the stories behind every dish. If you haven’t been yet, now’s the time to discover this culinary treasure. Trust us, it’s worth the hype! 🥂
