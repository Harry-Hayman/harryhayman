Just signed up for this and excited to attend...it seems so obvious, so true, and we've all heard it, "You are what you eat," but so few of us actually act on that knowledge (including yours truly all the time), but we have to.⁣

I am excited to see the progress the public health, scientific, producer, non-profit, and business communities are making around the idea of food is medicine: It can be transformative concept, and Food Tank is proud to join the White House Office of Public Engagement and many amazing partners in making it a reality.⁣
⁣
 So in just one week—June 20th—please join us via livestream for an extraordinary Food Tank Summit held in Boston, themed "Advancing Food is Medicine Approaches."⁣
⁣
 Please register now by https://bit.ly/3N6YWYO and mark your calendars for 12PM–4PM ET on Tuesday, June 20.⁣
