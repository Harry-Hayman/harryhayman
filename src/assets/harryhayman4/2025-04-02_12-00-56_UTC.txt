Still floating after seeing the one and only NNENNA FREELON grace the stage!

I don’t think I’ve seen her since we hosted her back in the day at Zanzibar Blue – and let me tell you, time may have passed, but her brilliance has only deepened. This wasn’t just a concert… it was a *masterclass in soul, storytelling, and sisterhood.*

Seven-time Grammy nominee. Collaborator with the greats like Ray Charles and Al Jarreau. And now? She’s still redefining the jazz canon with original music from her breathtaking new album Beneath the Skin.

Nnenna doesn’t just sing — she transcends. Every note was a prayer, a protest, a love letter. Her voice has always been velvet and fire, but now it carries decades of wisdom, grief, and grace. Whew. I’m still in awe.

Thank you, @ClefClubPhilly, for making space for legends to shine. And thank you, Nnenna, for continuing to pour your entire being into the music. Philly is forever better when you’re in town.
