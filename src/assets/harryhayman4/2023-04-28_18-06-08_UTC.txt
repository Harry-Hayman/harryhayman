I had a chance this week to attend an epic event, meet an epic person and be a part of the launch of an important next step in the history of urban agriculture in Philadelphia.⁣⁣
⁣
The event was the Growing from the Root: Philadelphia Urban Agriculture Plan Release Party, the person is Ash Richards, and the report is a  city-wide urban agriculture plan called Growing from the Root. It is the first plan of its kind for Philadelphia.⁣⁣
⁣
Ash Richards is Urban Agriculture Director at Philadelphia Parks and Recreation, managing the Farm Philly Program and the City’s first Urban Agriculture Plan, Growing from the Root.⁣⁣
⁣
In 2019 Philadelphia Parks & Recreation began work on a city-wide urban agriculture plan. The plan is called Growing from the Root.  The plan focuses on values of transparency, racial and economic justice, and inclusion.⁣⁣
