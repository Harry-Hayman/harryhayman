What a night to remember at the African American Chamber of Commerce Annual Dinner @ The Linc (and we got to go on the field to boot)! @official_aacc 

It was an absolute honor to be part of this inspiring event, celebrating the incredible accomplishments of our local business community. From networking opportunities to powerful speakers and interviewees, it was an evening filled with growth and empowerment.

A special acknowledgment to the visionary leader, Regina Hairston, whose dedication and tireless efforts continue to drive positive change. Regina, your leadership is a beacon of inspiration for us all.
The African American Chamber of Commerce plays a vital role in fostering diversity and inclusion in our business landscape. 

Together, we are building a stronger, more equitable future for all.
Let us carry the energy and enthusiasm from this event forward as we work together to achieve even greater heights - here's to many more successes ahead! #AACCDinner2024 #LeadershipMatters #businesscommunity

Thank you to everyone who made this evening truly remarkable. Looking forward to working together and let us keep the momentum going!
