LOOKING TO PROMOTE YOUR SHENANIGANS? 🤡
If you are a local business, send us the most absurd ad for your business you can think of; if it inspires a chuckle, we’ll print it in the passport.

HAVE AN IDEA FOR A FAKE AD FOR A FAKE PRODUCT/SERVICE AND TOO MUCH TIME ON YOUR HANDS? 🤖
We’d like to bamboozle the public by mixing in fake ads with the real ones. Send us your most ridiculous fake ad and we’ll pop that in the passport as well. 

Whoever gives the most insane ad real and/or fake will receive a prize announced at the festival on May 2nd!!!! 🏆🏆🏆

DO YOU HAVE UNFINISHED ARTWORK YOU THINK DESERVES A SECOND LIFE? 🎨🖌️
Don’t abandon a good idea or a bad one on the chopping block! We believe an unfinished project is just a collaboration in waiting! Create a masterpiece with the help of your community! Submit your unfinished drawings/paintings/etc. to be featured in the passport so fellow Eraserhood passerbys can color on them like a coloring book, take a picture of their additions, and tag you and the festival online to showcase your collaborative finished works! 

LOCAL ART! 🎭
Are you an Eraserhood artist looking to showcase your art/poetry/etc.? Submit it! We want to promote your creativity amidst the menagerie! ;P
