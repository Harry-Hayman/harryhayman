Just got my tickets!  The iconic Dance Theatre of Harlem returns to our stage with the world premiere of Blake Works IV (The Barre Project) by William Forsythe. This work is the latest in a continuously evolving series, The Barre Project, which originated digitally during the height of the pandemic when live performances weren’t possible. A sort of “love letter to dancers, to technique, to the possibilities of the ballet barre,” (Fjord Review) this new version was created specifically for Dance Theatre of Harlem, highlighting the diverse and formidable talents of this stunning company.⁣
Something you don’t want to miss.  The tickets are available at Zellerbach Theatre on January 20 – 21, 2023. Click the link for tickets  https://pennlivearts.org⁣
