Look forward to seeing everyone. An Evening with Starr, Vetri & Ellen Yin seems like yesterday! I was there 25 years ago!⁣
⁣
November 1st is An Evening with Starr, Vetri & Ellen Yin. In celebration of Fork’s 25th anniversary, restaurateur Ellen Yin welcomes long-tenured industry luminaries Stephen Starr and Marc Vetri, whose expertise spans two decades (and counting) each, for a conversation forecasting what the next 25 years hold for restaurants. This meeting of minds, moderated by author and The Welcome Conference founder Will Guidara, will kick off with a signing of Guidara’s just-released book, Unreasonable Hospitality, followed by drinks ＋ light bites.⁣
