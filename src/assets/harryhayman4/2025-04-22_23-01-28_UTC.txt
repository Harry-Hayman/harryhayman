STILL THE BADDEST BAR ON THE BLOCK 
Silk City was a whole movie. Food? Drinks? ðŸ’¯ Show? Off. The. Chain.

From start to finish, the Talent Showcase delivered â€” every artist shined. But letâ€™s be realâ€¦

MAJORKEY is her.
Breakout star. Commanding presence. A voice and vision you canâ€™t ignore.

And if you think weâ€™re hyping it? Donâ€™t take our word for it.

Come see for yourself at her ALBUM RELEASE PARTY
Back at Silk City
April 29
Doors at 7PM | Show starts at 8PM
Presented by @sgentertainmentphl & @insomniaproductions

Come for the vibes. Stay for the greatness.
