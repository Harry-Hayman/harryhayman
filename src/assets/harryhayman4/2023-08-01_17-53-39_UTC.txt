Such a wonderful time with family this weekend in Ocean City, Maryland…great to jump in the ocean, read a little, get a little sun, and a lot of R & R…I was debating whether to go or not because I have so much work but you have too…and I’m glad I did…but now back to the grind.

 Want to acknowledge some great restaurants we made it to…Patsy's Restaurant, Bethany Beach, DE Chef owned, Key West and Southern Inspired Cuisine ~ Great Seafood and Local Organic Farm Produce, Indoor and Outdoor Dining = Creative Coastal Cuisine
 
I would be remiss if I didn’t include Bishopville’s longtime dining destination, Grove Market. Co-owner Leslie Lunga decided she’d had enough and placed the wildly popular spot into the capable hands of Brett Fetterolf and his dad Bill (former boss at Talbot Street Cafe in Ocean City). Brett is also the creator and co-owner of Elvis' Beach Bar in Sandy Ground, Road Bay on the Caribbean island of Anguilla. The one-of-a-kind reservations system at Grove Market remains in place. It’s part of their charm.
