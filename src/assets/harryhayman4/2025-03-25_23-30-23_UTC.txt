📢 Shoutout to the amazing Waialua Community Association! 🌍💙

While I was away, I had the honor of volunteering with Linda & her incredible team—feeding those in need every Wednesday. It’s a reminder that even in places of luxury, many people still struggle.

Much love to my parents, local military, and fellow volunteers who showed up to help! If you have time or a few dollars to spare, consider giving back. 🙌
