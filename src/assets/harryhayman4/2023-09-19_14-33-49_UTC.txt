Another absolutely amazing event this weekend it was at the Old Leader Theater!

Hosted by two incredible organizations, Now & Then Marketplace and Meantime, the event was a true celebration of Philadelphia's creativity, community, and culture.
Now & Then Marketplace brought together an array of unique vendors, showcasing everything from vintage treasures to handmade crafts and highlighting the Old Leader Theaterâ€™s unique architecture.

Meantime is an initiative committed to activating underutilized street-facing commercial spaces in service of urban communities. Working between the real estate industry, city government, creative producers, small business entrepreneurs and neighborhood stakeholders, the project aims to facilitate connections, test ideas, reach new audiences and support local economies.

Beyond the shopping and the food, what truly made this event special was the sense of togetherness. It's events like these that remind us of the vibrant and supportive community we're part of. 

Huge acknowledgments to Now & Then Marketplace and Meantime for making it all happen! Your passion for what you do shines through, and we can't wait for the next one. Keep up the fantastic work!
