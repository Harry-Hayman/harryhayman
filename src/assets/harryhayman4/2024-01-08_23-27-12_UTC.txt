Let's Celebrate Local Flavors! 

Thrilled to discover a gem in our city's culinary scene – Satay, the newest Indonesian restaurant in Philly! As Sr. Fellow to the food economy and policy, it's not just a pleasure but part of my job to champion and support diverse, local businesses that bring unique flavors to our tables. 

Calling on all food enthusiasts to join me in giving Satay some love – a vibrant addition to our growing food landscape. Let's savor the richness of Indonesian cuisine and show our support for the incredible culinary talent right here in Philly.
