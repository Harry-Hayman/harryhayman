Signed up for another season at Spring Gardens!  Third time is the charm (I hope!)…I’ve learned a lot my first 2 seasons…mostly what NOT to do, but that is okay…I’m going to knock it out of the park this season…looking forward to spending time w/ all my friends over at Spring Gardens this summer!⁣
The Spring Gardens is an urban community garden in Spring Garden, Philadelphia, built by neighbors in 1995 and helps families grow food and flowers for themselves and for donation through City Harvest.⁣
Local community gardens are critical…⁣
Community gardens can help reduce negative environmental impacts by promoting sustainable agriculture, reducing food transportation costs, and reducing water runoff. Humans, plants and animals can all benefit from urban agriculture since it creates habitats and improves the ecology of the area.⁣
