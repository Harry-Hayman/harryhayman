Did you know NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang started as a dishwasher? ðŸ§¼
 He worked his way up and built an empire. 
Personally, I started my career as a dishwasher at the age of 17, too. It wasnâ€™t glamorous, but it taught me hard work and perseverance. Over the years, I climbed through the ranks in the hospitality industry, from washing dishes to running operations and launching businesses like Bynum Hospitality Group and Gemini Hospitality Consultants. Early jobs donâ€™t define youâ€”it's your hustle and the lessons you learn that shape your future. Now, through Feed Philly Coalition and The Philadelphia Jazz Experience, Iâ€™m focused on giving back and making an impact. Keep pushing forwardâ€”you never know where itâ€™ll take you. ðŸ’ª
