Just a quick post here to acknowledge a truly beautiful and powerful day it was at the "House of Living Unveiling" at Christa Barfield, FarmerJawn's Elkins' Park farm.

Surrounded by nature and community, we celebrated a vision turned into reality. The House of Living stands as a testament to the boundless potential of unity, determination and life everlasting.

Thank you, Christa, Brandon, FarmerJawn & Friends Foundation Fund, MIR Healing Center and Swarthmore College, for inspiring us all. Together, we continue to nurture change, growth and moving forward while never forgetting where weâ€™ve been and those we have lost along the way.
