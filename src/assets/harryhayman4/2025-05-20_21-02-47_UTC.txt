My friend Angie Wells LIT UP the stage at SOUTH this past weekend â€” and weâ€™re still recovering from the sheer velvet of it all.
From the moment she stepped up to the mic, it was smoke, soul, and swing â€” like a 1940s Parisian jazz club met a Philly summer night and decided to fall in love.

- Her voice? Silk-wrapped sass with a splash of bourbon (ask me how I know!).
- Her presence? Pure cinematic electricity.
- The vibe? Unapologetically grown and impossibly cool.

If you missed it, weâ€™re sorry for your loss. But if you were thereâ€¦ you already know. ðŸ”¥

- SOUTH â€” Where legends pass through and magic lingers.

Stay tuned for more nights like this summer. Weâ€™re just starting to heat up.
