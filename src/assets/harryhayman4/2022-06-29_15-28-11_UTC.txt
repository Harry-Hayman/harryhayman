Every child deserves to eat this summer. It’s time to take action and participate in the Let’s Eat Program by Philabundance.  Weekly, we work with Philabudance by donating time and resources to ensure that children eat throughout the summer.⁣
When the school year ends in June, kids lose access to free school breakfast and lunch programs. Without these programs, kids often need help to access fresh and nutritious foods over the summer.⁣
⁣
To help combat child summer hunger, Philabundance launched a meal box program called “Let’s Eat.”⁣
Began on June 13th, we will distribute 2,000 meal kits per week for eight weeks, each providing eight meals. Who’s ready to get involved? https://www.philabundance.org/lets-eat/
