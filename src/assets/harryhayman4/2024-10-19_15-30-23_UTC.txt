What an incredible (official) start to #GPLEX! 🎉 The opening reception was filled with energy, creativity, and inspiring conversations! 🙌 It was amazing to see the fruits of the labor, planning and so many passionate individuals come together, share ideas, and set the stage for an unforgettable event.
A huge thank you to everyone who attended the opening reception, and to Kejsi, Tiara, and Rama for putting together such a fantastic kickoff as well as to our sponsors! 👏✨ Let’s keep the momentum going! 💡🔥
