Today is your day to support #blackowned restaurants around the nation! You all know how much I love a good meal, and it is my honor to support #blackowned restaurants in my area. I will definitely be supporting this cause, and you should too! Download the EatOkra app on your phone for a full list of black-owned restaurants in your area! Additionally, The Great American Takeout team will be donating up to $25,000 to the #BlackLivesMatter movement! They will be contributing $5 for every social media post featuring a takeout meal from a black-owned restaurant using the hashtag #TheGreatAmericanTakeout.⠀
