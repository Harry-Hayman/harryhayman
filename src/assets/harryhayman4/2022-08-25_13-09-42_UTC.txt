How do we effectively impact change? Thatâ€™s the age-old question, but the most important thing is that IMPACT PHL is gathering thought leaders together to dialogue about lasting solutions. 
ImpactPHL envisions Greater Philadelphia as a leader in the global impact economy. By aligning our collective financial assets and regional economy with social and environmental goals, we will create an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient economy that works for all our residents.
Look out for more events from Feed Philly, Impact PHL, and more.
