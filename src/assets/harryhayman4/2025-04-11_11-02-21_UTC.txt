🎥 Behind the Scenes: I AM HUNGRY IN PHILLY
We just watched the first assembly cut of I Am Hungry in Philadelphia — and it’s powerful.
This doc isn’t just about food insecurity. It’s about the 312,000 Philadelphians facing it daily, and the urgent work to change that.
Huge shoutout to our Emmy-winning director Kalani Davis for helping us shape the vision.
The journey’s far from over — but the story is taking shape. And it's one Philly needs to hear.

🔁 Stay tuned. We're just getting started.
