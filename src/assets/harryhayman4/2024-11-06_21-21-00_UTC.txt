🚜 Join Us in Supporting Philadelphia’s Next Generation of Agricultural Innovators! 🌱

On Thursday, November 7, 2024, Fox Chase Farm is launching its first student-run franchised farmer’s market at Crossroads Accelerated Academy, and we invite you to come out and support this transformative initiative!

🗓 Date: November 7, 2024
🕙 Time: 10:00 AM
📍 Location: Crossroads Accelerated Academy, 4300 Westminster Ave #2, Philadelphia, PA 19104

Why This Matters: This market is not just about selling produce. It’s about empowering students from the Fox Chase Farm Ag Empowerment and Pre-CTE Green Careers Program to take control of every aspect of the market—growing, producing, marketing, and selling! Through hands-on experience, they are learning valuable skills and exploring career paths in agriculture, agribusiness, and environmental sustainability. Plus, this market will directly address food insecurity in a community facing critical challenges.

🔑 Key Highlights:

Hands-On Student Involvement: Students grow, produce, and manage the market.
Combatting Food Insecurity: Serving a designated food desert community.
Career Prep: Supported by Dr. Mandy Manna and Dr. Kim Grahn, this initiative prepares students for leadership in agriculture and sustainability sectors.
We’d love for you to be there to celebrate the hard work of these students and show your support for Philadelphia’s future agricultural leaders. Whether you’re involved in education, sustainability, or community development, this is a great opportunity to see positive change in action.

Let’s come together to support our city’s youth and their innovative solutions to real-world challenges! If you plan to attend or have any questions, please reach out to Dr. Mandy Manna at mhilbert@philasd.org.
