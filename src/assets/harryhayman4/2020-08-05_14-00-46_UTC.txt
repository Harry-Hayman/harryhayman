Most people who know me, know that I'm an avid reader. Currently I’m reading David Shulkin's new book, “It Shouldn’t be This Hard to Serve Your Country.” This book is enlightening, and I encourage you to add this one to your list! #newbooks #goodread #davidshulkin #2019books #books #booklover #booknerd #bookstagram #literature #va #veterans #military #veteran #army #marines #navy #airforce #usa #government
