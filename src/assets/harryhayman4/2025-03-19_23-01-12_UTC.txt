Hawaii wasn’t just about relaxation—I had the chance to dive into something truly game-changing: the Food is Medicine pilot program. 🍎💊 This initiative is reshaping healthcare by using nutrition as treatment, and Hawaii has been ahead of the curve for years. 🌿

Stay tuned—Feed Philly Coalition is working to make a real impact! 💪 #FoodIsMedicine #HealthThroughFood #NutritionMatters
