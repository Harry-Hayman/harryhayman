I just wanted to say how incredibly proud I am of my friend Christa and all of her accomplishments, including her latest, Philadelphia Magazine's Luminary Award 2023.  Proud to be doing my small part to help her mission. ⁣

Special thanks to Philadelphia Magazine. A lot of incredible people/friends in the house, including Ellen Yin, Eli Kulp, and Peter Breslow, among others.⁣

THE LUMINARY LEADER:  This award will honor an up-and-coming woman, age 35 and under, who has already made a mark on our region.  Congratulations to  Christa Barfield, the founder and owner of Viva Leaf Tea, a farm-to-cup tea brand, and FarmerJawn, a community greenhouse and CSA in Philadelphia; her epiphany moment came in January 2018 during a trip to Martinique. Her experiences there catapulted her out of a career in healthcare and into her new identity as an urban farmer and wellness herbalist.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
FarmerJawn follows regenerative farming practices concentrating on soil health and increasing access to organic food to marginalized communities.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The city of Philadelphia is plagued with food-insecure families that work 40＋ hours per week and still don't have access to chemical-free food options. One because they don't understand the importance of it, and two because the access just isn't there.⁣⁣⁣
