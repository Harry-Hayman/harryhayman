This week we had an electric board meeting and strategy session with the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia.
The brilliance in the room. The vision in the air. The determination to drive real, measurable, inclusive economic change for this region? Palpable. Special thanks for Meg and Mike and all that are leading this charge.

We’re not just talking about closing gaps — we’re engineering a future where every zip code has a seat at the table. From supplier diversity to workforce pipelines, food equity to innovation economies — the work is hard, the stakes are high, and I’m proud to be doing my part.

This wasn't your average board meeting. This is where bold ideas meet real action. Proud to be on this ride with a team that doesn’t flinch at the big questions — we lean in, dig deep, and BUILD.

Let’s keep pushing. Our city’s future is worth it.
