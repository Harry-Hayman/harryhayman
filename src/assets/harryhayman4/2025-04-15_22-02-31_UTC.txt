CHECK OUT THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN MARKET
I got a chance to make it to Opening Day at the Southeast Asian Market at FDR Parkâ€”and let me tell you, itâ€™s not a market, itâ€™s a damn flavor festival explosion wrapped in a cultural love letter.

I've been before but it was good to go again and check it out - if you have not been, it's worth going by

Youâ€™ve got: ðŸ¥¢ Cambodian skewers grilling with soul
Vietnamese pho that made me emotional
Sweet sticky rice from Laos that should be illegal

Thai, Indonesian, Malaysian flavor bombs around every corner
VeganOptions?  Have to look but scallion pancakes, leek pies, tofu fried rice (no egg) etc. they're there!
And the people? The energy? Electric. Families, kids, elders, vendorsâ€”all showing up and showing OUT. Phillyâ€™s immigrant communities have turned FDR into one of the most essential food experiences in the city (donâ€™t take my word for itâ€”The Inquirer said it too).

Open weekends for the next six months
FDR Park â€“ you can smell the lemongrass from Broad Street
Bring cash, bring friends, bring an empty stomach and some respect

This is Philly at its absolute best: community, culture, and damn good cooking. Go this weekend. Donâ€™t play yourself.
