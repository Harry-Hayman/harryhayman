Recently I had a chance to attend a wonderful performance and interpretation of La Boheme - Great job by all and especially the Kimmel Center.⁣
La Boheme’s relatable themes and beautiful scenes make it an undeniable Italian classic and one of the most commonly performed operas in the world. Set in Paris in the 1800s, La Boheme follows and covers the lives of “bohemians,” a group of low-income artisans.⁣
The Philadelphia Orchestra and Kimmel Center, Inc., shares the transformative power of the performing arts and arts education with the widest possible audience.  The vision is to inspire and connect humanity with exceptional performances and experiences serving Philadelphia and the world.⁣
