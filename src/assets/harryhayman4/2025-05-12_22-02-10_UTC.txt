THIS S$%^T WAS ON FIRE!
If you know jazz, you already know the name Lakecia Benjamin. But if you’ve ever felt jazz—deep in your bones, rippling through your soul like spirit catching fire—you know she’s something far beyond that.

We didn't just get a concert, we get a sonic resurrection.
Lakecia takes the sacred flame of John Coltrane and ignites it anew—with ferocity, with reverence, and with every ounce of her being. This is more than a tribute. This is an ancestral summoning. This is jazz alive, roaring, weeping, testifying.

Don’t miss this once-in-a-generation artist channeling the cosmic genius of Coltrane with her signature fire and fearless vision.
💥 It's not just music. It’s a spiritual awakening set to saxophone.

🕊️ Come ready to FEEL. Come ready to ASCEND.
