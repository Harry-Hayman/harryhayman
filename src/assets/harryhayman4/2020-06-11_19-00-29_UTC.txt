The restaurant industry, especially in #Philadelphia, took a huge hit during the pandemic. The question on everyone’s mind is what life will be like for restaurants in a post-COVID-19 world. Check out this fantastic quote from InsideHook that discusses that very topic with celebrity chef #RobertIrvine.⠀

“For me, it’s not a bad pivot,” Irvine says. “For some people, it’s going to be life-changing. The cleanliness and the health of people have always been a focus for me, as well as the food and the place. Now, I’ve got to go into a restaurant that mom and pop have had for 36 years where they don’t have enough money to get a new refrigerator or put a gasket on a refrigerator and now there are going to be a whole new set of rules, otherwise they can’t open. They’re the people I need to help. I don’t need to help the chain that’s got all the money in the world and can afford to train and teach. Education is going to be an ongoing thing and I think it will help slightly, but we’ve got a long way to go.”⠀
