Exciting meeting with Kevin Doyle from Envista Farms and Ashley Harder, CYTOPHL's Director of Community and Public Relations - looking forward to making big things happen in Philly with Indoor Agriculture.⁣
Envista Farms is converting old warehouses, industrial buildings, and greenhouses into certified hydroponic growing facilities for herbs and vegetables.⁣
The convergence of low-cost LED lights, affordable and suitable facilities, and the ability to heat and cool farms economically has led to growing herbs and vegetables all year round in a controlled environment.
