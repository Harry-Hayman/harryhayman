So good to attend The Food Policy Advisory Council's Anti-Hunger Subcommittee meeting yesterday.

Want to acknowledge Erica Miles and Saleem Chapman and all their hard work at the Department of Sustainability

Mission: The Philadelphia Food Policy Advisory Council connects Philadelphians and their local government to create a more just food system.
Vision: The Philadelphia Food Policy Advisory Council envisions a food system where all people in Philadelphia have the power and resources to access and control our food, land, and labor.
