Very much looking for to the PAGE SUMMIT...such important work being done.  Tue, February 21, 2023, 4:00 PM – 7:00 PM EST⁣
⁣
Join the Economy League and our partners at the 2023 PAGE Summit to reflect on successes and impact. More importantly, to plan, strategize, and turbo-charge our movement for equitable and inclusive growth.⁣
⁣
Join us to help build the programs and partnerships necessary to transform Philadelphia into a national leader for minority entrepreneurship, equitable and inclusive growth, and civic engagement.⁣
⁣
Suppose you are a procurement professional at a major institution, a current or prospective supplier, or a civic leader concerned with equity and inclusion. In that case, you will not want to miss the 2023 PAGE Summit at the African American Museum of Philadelphia this February!⁣
