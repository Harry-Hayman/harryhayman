What am I up to - Wednesdays!

I’m cutting back on meat! I really shouldn’t eat it at all, but I'm just not there... yet! Shout out to my friend Geoff who is though! Love you buddy! Meat production severely impacts our environment, and the world! I know I need to do better — hell, I will do better. We all should! I am committed to becoming who I want to be! #workmerk #VSP #vegan #livenation #purplecarrot #healthyeating #plantbased #veganlifestyle #instafood #instagood #cleaneating #savetheworld #meatlessmondays
