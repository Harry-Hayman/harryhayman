I just got my tickets for GODSPELL and I am very much looking forward to seeing it again…”When will Thou Save The People!?!” …F’N love GODSPELL (and I got a plan…”STW”…you heard it here first). If you have not seen it yet, it is definitely worth checking out…here is the link if you are interested: https://new-light-theatre.ticketleap.com/nlt-godspell/

If you are not familiar with GODPELL, here we go! About GODSPELL…Godspell is a musical composed by Stephen Schwartz with a book by John-Michael Tebelak. The show is structured as a series of parables, primarily based on the Gospel of Matthew, interspersed with music mostly set to lyrics from traditional hymns, with the passion of Christ appearing briefly near the end.

For those who know me, they know I stay away from bantering about politics, religion and such so I am not recommending this based on anything religious, but rather the questions it asks us all, the answers we hopefully will formulate, the (usually) visually stunning set design as well as the powerful lyrics and beautiful songs.

Hit me back after you see it and let me know what you think!
