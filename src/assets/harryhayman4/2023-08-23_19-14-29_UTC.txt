So very much looking forward to this weekend's performance of The String Queens...it should be noted that behind every delicious dish, award-winning service, incredible ambiance, world-class jazz, and unforgettable dining experience, there's a team that makes it all possible. Teamwork isn't just a choice; it's the secret ingredient that keeps our restaurant running smoothly and our guests' satisfaction soaring high. From the cleaning crew, to dish, to prep, to the kitchen to the front of house, servers, bartenders, host/hostesses, sound, management and ownership, it's the collective effort that turns moments into memories and we thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. #TeamworkMakesTheDreamWork #RestaurantLife" August 25, 2023, until August 26, 2023 @southjazzkitchen @thestringqueens

“Praised for its authentic, soulful, and orchestral sound, The String Queens is a dynamic trio that creates stimulating musical experiences that inspire audiences to love, hope, feel and imagine! Along with other select repertoire, the ladies will perform music from their new release, RISE, which showcases the group's vibrant sound with fresh takes on the music of contemporary soul legends and pop icons.”

About why music makes us happy: Our favorite melodies release dopamine, known as the feel-good hormone, which activates our brain’s pleasure and reward system. Music can have a positive, immediate impact on our mental state; fast tempos can psychologically and physiologically arouse us, helping energize us for the day.
