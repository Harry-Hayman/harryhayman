So happy to be actively involved with my community garden, and they are amazing!⁣

The Spring Gardens is an urban community garden in Spring Garden, Philadelphia, built by neighbors in 1995 and helps families grow food and flowers for themselves and donation through City Harvest.⁣

The Many Benefits of Community Gardens⁣
⁣
🥦Help improve air and soil quality⁣
🥦Increase biodiversity of plants and animals⁣
🥦Reduce “food miles” that are required to transport nutritious food⁣
🥦Can replace impervious structures and improve water infiltration⁣
🥦Can reduce neighborhood waste through composting⁣
🥦 Positively impact the urban micro-climate⁣
⁣
Poor nutrition and obesity are both challenges to low-income neighborhoods. Low accessibility to nutritious foods can cause health problems for residents located in food deserts. Adding gardens to these areas may improve nutrition and increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables.⁣
