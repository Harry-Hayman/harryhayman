Flashback Fridays!
My favorite place in the whole wide world is Eastern College… Well now, University! I played ice hockey there when I was a kid! What can I say? I’m like the new Tony Campolo! Roger Staubach and Tom Landry often speak there, as well! I remember I used to, and still do, go to John's hoagies. They have the #besthoagies ever. I even made love there quite a few times. #TMI #sexeducation #thingsyoudidntknow #FBF #instafood #EasternUniversity
