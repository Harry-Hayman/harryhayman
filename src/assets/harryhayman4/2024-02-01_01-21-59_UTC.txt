Thrilled to shout out Two Locals Brewing Co., Philadelphia's FIRST Black-owned brewery, masterminded by the visionaries, and my good friends, the Koilor brothers. From backyard brewing to opening their doors in University City, their journey is nothing short of inspiring. ðŸŒŸ Their brews tell a rich story of culture, ambition, and community. 

Join me in supporting @twolocals and make sure to taste the legacy they're building, one beer at a time.
