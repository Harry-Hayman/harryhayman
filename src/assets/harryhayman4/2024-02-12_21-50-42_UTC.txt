Supporting local, diverse, and equitable businesses is not just about making a purchaseâ€”it's an investment in the heart and soul of our community. 

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, driving innovation, creating jobs, and enriching the cultural fabric of our neighborhoods. 

Now, more than ever, it's crucial that we are intentional in our support, amplifying the voices of underrepresented entrepreneurs and championing equitable opportunities for all.

I had the pleasure and honor of sitting down with Shakia Williams, owner and winemaker of Cyrenity Sips Winery. @cyrenitysips

We met at Coffee Cream & Dreams, a local diversely owned and operated coffee shop, where we discussed Shakia's dedication to her craft and her commitment to creating a space where everyone feels welcome and valued. 

Her winery not only produces exceptional wines but also serves as a beacon of diversity and inclusivity in our community.

As we navigate these challenging times, let's remember the incredible importance of supporting businesses like Cyrenity Sips Winery and Coffee Cream & Dreams. 
By choosing to shop local, we are not only investing in the success of our neighbors but also fostering a more resilient and vibrant economy for generations to come.
