Still working on getting this vegan thing down! These are two of my meals this week. The first is a vegan mushroom #cheesesteak topped with zucchini squash and “smashed” avocado. The second is a #tofu “steak” with #sauteed baby bella mushrooms, zucchini, squash, Carmelized onions, brown rice.  #plantbased #veganfood #vegetarian #healthyfood #crueltyfree #food #organic #healthy #veganlife #healthylifestyle #govegan #foodie #foodporn #vegansofig #veganrecipes #love #veganism #instafood #vegano #natural #whatveganseat #fitness #veganfoodshare #health #yummy #dairyfree #homemade
