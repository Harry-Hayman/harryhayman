Happy Ides of March - Don't often drink but when I do, I try and make it a good one and this is one is no exception...first of all, stellar old Fashion from SOUTH and for a wonderful cause!⁣
From January through March, in honor of MLK Jr. Day, Black History Month (BHM) and Women’s History Month (WHM), Uncle Nearest is partnering with bars & restaurants, stores, our eCommerce accounts and our Uncle Nearest #WhiskeyFamily to raise up to $1 Million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).⁣
As reported by FORBES, CBS, PARENTS MAGAZINE, NPR, BLACK ENTERPRISE, TCF.org and dozens of other media outlets, HBCUs have been grossly underfunded by at least $12.8 billion over the past 30 years. Uncle Nearest, along with your help, will work to shine a light on this disparity in funding. But as with everything we do, we will not just talk about it, we will put our money where our mouth is, and pledge $1 for every Old Fashioned cocktail sold across the country beginning on MLK Jr. Day on January 16th and continuing through the end of Women’s History Month.⁣
