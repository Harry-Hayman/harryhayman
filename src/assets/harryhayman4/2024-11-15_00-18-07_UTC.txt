An Incredible Week of Exciting Events!

Last week was transformative, filled with inspiring moments and impactful discussions! From attending a powerful equine therapy conference with @DrMandyManna, where we explored the profound impact of horses and donkeys on mental health - wonderful that the School District is addressing this pervasive issue, to Thursday’s groundbreaking press conference addressing local food production and tackling food deserts through our local school districts and then finally working on figuring out how we can localize our school meal production while empowering local entrepeneurs—it’s been all about advancing real change for our community.  Kudos to Dr. Manna and progressive School District leadership.

Excited to keep pushing forward with these vital initiatives and doing any part I can to help, from food justice to mental health awareness. Together, we’re making a difference every step of the way!
