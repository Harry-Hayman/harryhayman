LUHV at First Bite 

So there I was... CRAVING an Italian hoagie like it was a scene out of The Sopranos. But here's the thing: most of what's on a traditional hoagie? Not my vibe anymore and really shouldn't be anyone's if you read the latest. 

Enter: LUHV Vegan Deli — the absolute game-changer in the sandwich universe. Located in the heart of Reading Terminal Market and in S. Philly, this place didn’t just meet the craving… it transcended it. 🙌🏽

Their vegan Italian hoagie was a symphony of flavors. No meat. No dairy. No compromises. Just pure, plant-based excellence that made my taste buds do the salsa (or maybe it was a samba—either way, it slapped).

Shoutout to the visionary behind it all—the owner of LUHV, who is serving up not just food, but compassion, innovation, and community with every sandwich. 

Veganism isn’t just a trend—it’s a movement. It’s better for our bodies, the animals, AND the planet. And with food like this? It’s also just plain delicious.

So if you haven’t been to LUHV yet—go. Go now. Bring a friend. Bring your meat-loving uncle. Blow their minds.
