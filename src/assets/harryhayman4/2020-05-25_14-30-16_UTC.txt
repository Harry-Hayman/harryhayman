What I miss Most Mondays - Going to my Grandma's and seeing my Grandpa, WWII veteran, Harry Graham Hayman II! On this day, I wanted to give a big shout out to him and other brave men and women that have served to protect the values our nation holds so dear. #MemorialDay #USA #honor #veterans #livefree #mondaymotivation #respect
