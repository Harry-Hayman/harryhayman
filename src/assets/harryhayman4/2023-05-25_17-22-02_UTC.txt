Tina Turner - one of rock's great vocalists, most charismatic performers and someone near and dear to my heart growing up - has died. 
 
She died peacefully after a long illness in her home in KÃ¼snacht near Zurich, Switzerland, her representative said.
 
Tina Turner, the unstoppable musical force with hits like "What's Love Got to Do With It. Her musical legacy will live on forever.
