If you checked out some of my other videos, you’ve seen a lot of the things I’m passionate about, and filmmaking is top on my list. 3 Hearts, a production company named after my father and my two brothers, working on getting my creative stories out there. I’ve been working on the 
Boys Weekends project, about my high school friends, 14 of us, showing them how much I love and care about them and to see how much we still have in common. I write in my copious free time to get some interesting stories down in black and white. If I could just do one thing, this would be it 

Good things coming from the 3 Hearts experience. So stay tuned.
