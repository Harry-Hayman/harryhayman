Another Unforgettable Night at SOUTH! 

What a night at SOUTH RESTAURANT & JAZZ CLUB! The drinks were flowing (shoutout to my personal favorite, the SOUTH Sazerac), the food was looking incredible—special love to the Vegan Jambalaya —and the music? Absolutely next level.

V. Shayne Frederick set the club on fire with an all-star lineup featuring Aaron Graves on piano, Hiruy Tirfe on sax, Nimrod Speaks on bass, and Khary Abdul-Shaheed on drums. Philadelphia’s finest musicians, delivering pure magic on stage! 

If you missed this one, don’t make the same mistake twice—come experience the best jazz, food, and cocktails in the city (country?  World?) at SOUTH. See you at the next set!  #JazzAtSOUTH #LiveMusicPhilly #PhillyJazz #SazeracAndSounds
