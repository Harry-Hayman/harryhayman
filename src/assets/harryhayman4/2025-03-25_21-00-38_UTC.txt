This Event at @inliquidart was nothing short of MAGIC.
The March for Art: EAT! event blended food, flavor, and fine art into an unforgettable night. Two culinary legends — Chef Ange Branca & Chef Guillermo Veloso — served up mind-blowing dishes surrounded by jaw-dropping local artwork… all inside one of Philly’s coolest galleries.

@inliquidart continues to be a creative powerhouse, lifting up local artists, curating bold experiences, and reminding us that art belongs to everyone.

Getting to meet the visionary behind it all — Rachel Zimmerman — was a gift. Her passion and leadership are what make InLiquid more than a gallery. It’s a movement.

Thank you for doing what you do. If you’re not following or supporting InLiquid yet, fix that — this is Philly culture at its finest. 💫🎭🍽️🖼️ #InLiquidArt #MarchForArt #SupportLocalArt #PhillyArts #ArtAndSoul
