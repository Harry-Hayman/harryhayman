Over-the-Top Flavor Bomb
BAD. ASS. TACOS.

Rolled out of Silk City rehearsal for Tuesdayâ€™s Manifesto Album Release Party and straight into taco heaven at California Tacos (5th & Spring Garden). 

These are the kind of tacos that stop you mid-bite and make you reconsider your entire relationship with food. Authentic. Messy. Bold. Delicious. GO.

Support the folks doing it right in Philly. Go grab some and tag me when you do.
