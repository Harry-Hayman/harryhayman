Playing hooky on a rainy Friday afternoon...

Don’t tell anyone — but I snuck out to run to take in Mahler's #6.

1:30 PM — Dip out
2:00 PM — let Mahler’s Symphony No. 6 wash over me
3:30 PM — float back through the city in an Uber with unexpected dance hall vibes, soul stirred, heart pounding
4:00 PM — Next Meeting/Soundcheck for the band
Huge shout out to Yannick Nézet-Séguin — watching him command the orchestra is like witnessing a magician pull emotion from the air. 

For the uninitiated: Mahler’s 6th (aka the “Tragic”) is no easy ride — it’s thunderous, complex, and achingly human. It’s about fate, love, and loss, wrapped in sound so big it rattles your chest. If you’ve never seen it live, fix that.

Rainy day magic is real. Mahler proved it.
