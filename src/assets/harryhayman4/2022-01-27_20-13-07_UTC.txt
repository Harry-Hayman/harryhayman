Remembering Meat Loaf, a Singer Who Was Larger Than Life
He was unlike any other musician. So it’s no surprise his origin story is equally unique. Receiving an inheritance from his mother’s death, he moved to LA to pursue his ambitions as a singer. But acting would turn out to be his real start. He was cast in stage productions of Hair in Detroit, LA, and eventually on Broadway. Which makes sense. 
RIP MEATLOAF.
