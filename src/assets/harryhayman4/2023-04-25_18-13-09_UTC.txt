It's that time of year again...gardening time!  I enjoyed the class with Master Gardener Doris Stahl,  a Horticultural Educator with Philadelphia Penn State Extension⁣. ⁣

Brought to me by my community garden, The Spring Gardens. ⁣

Here is a little more about The Spring Gardens for those interested:⁣⁣
The Spring Gardens Community Gardens are currently managed by a volunteer Steering Committee of neighborhood gardeners. ⁣
⁣
The Steering Committee meets monthly and oversees planning, project implementation, fundraising, and policy making. All gardeners contribute to the Gardens’ maintenance, including general weeding, planting, mowing, and carpentry. Membership meetings, garden events, and dinners occur regularly. Additional Operational Committees contribute much of the ongoing design, maintenance, volunteer coordination, and other activities necessary to ensure a smooth operation of the community resource. https://thespringgardens.org/about⁣⁣
