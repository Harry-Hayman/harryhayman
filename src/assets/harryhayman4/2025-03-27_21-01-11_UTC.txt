I FORGOT how ridiculously cool the Ritz-Carlton in Philly is…

Going to see a friend at the W and walking into that jaw-dropping rotunda felt like stepping onto the set of a movie—grand, dramatic, and dripping in luxury. The energy? Immaculate. The vibe? Pure class with a twist of modern swagger.
And @AqimeroPhilly? Whew. That restaurant is not playing. From the first bite to the last sip, it was a full-on culinary experience. Elegant, elevated, and effortlessly sexy. 

Also want to acknowledge Ryan at the bar—this man delivered next-level hospitality with precision, charm, and just the right amount of flair - ask for him by name. If you’re lucky enough to sit in his section, you’re in for a treat. 
Consider this your reminder: The Ritz-Carlton Philly is still THAT place. Whether it’s a power lunch, date night, or you just want to feel fancy on a Tuesday... don’t miss this gem in the heart of the city.
