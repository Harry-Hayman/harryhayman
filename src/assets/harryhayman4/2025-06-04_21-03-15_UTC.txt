THIS WEEKEND at SOUTH: An UNFORGETTABLE jazz experience 

We are beyond honored to welcome the legendary Steve Turre — a true titan of jazz, whose career spans playing with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, Ray Charles, and over 30 years lighting up the stage with the Saturday Night Live Band. Oh, and did we mention he’s a virtuoso on conch shells? Yeah, you read that right.

Steve Turre isn’t just playing — he’s bringing a literal dream team of sidemen (and woman) with him to SOUTH:

Wallace Roney Jr. – Trumpet phenom and keeper of a storied jazz lineage.
Mike Lee – Sax and flute powerhouse, master of both fire and finesse.
ELEW (Eric Lewis) – Piano wizard blending explosive technique with pure soul.
Kenny Davis – A bass legend who brings depth and groove you can feel in your bones.
Chris Beck – Drum dynamo, the heartbeat of the band with a pulse that won't quit.
Andromeda Turre – A voice of silk and steel, elevating every note to the heavens.

May 30-31 | 📍 SOUTH Jazz Club
Two nights. One historic event. 

This is not just another gig — it's a masterclass in jazz history, happening live and up-close.
