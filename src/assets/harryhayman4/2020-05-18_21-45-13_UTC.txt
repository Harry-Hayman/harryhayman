What do I miss most - Mondays!

Delivering food to those who need it more than I! Although, the need is so great we are having to brave the circumstances! I can always contribute more to those around me! We, Feed Philly Coalition, got an anonymous donation from some neighbors who wanted to help out — Wow! An act of kindness like this definitely restores your faith in humanity! Thanks to SOUTH for helping us out w/ the sides! We’re donating salmon this week!
