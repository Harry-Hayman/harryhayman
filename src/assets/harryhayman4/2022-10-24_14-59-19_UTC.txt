We are excited about the upcoming ACT 2, 2022 Holiday Line-Up. Focusing on IT IS BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE. The holiday line-up begins with Alyn Waller & Friends' "INFLUENCES" Benefit Concert - SUN NOV 27 @ 5 PM & 8 PM
VERY SPECIAL EVENT, which we have the opportunity to make a difference - to INFLUENCE change. INFLUENCES with Alyn Waller & Friends is a concert to benefit Taylor MADE Opportunities.
INFLUENCES features Alyn Waller & Friends in a multi-faceted show in which the many musical talents of Alyn Waller come to the stage. The prolific preacher-teacher, well known for his rich and powerful, classically trained vocals, shares the 'influences' of his artistry with the gospel, R&B standards, and some original music, as well as his profound instrumentation on Flugelhorn, piano, and guitar. All proceeds benefit Taylor MADE Opportunities, a non-profit organization designed to prevent and interrupt the cycle of poverty and gun violence through Mentoring, Advocacy, Development, and Education. TICKETS ARE FOR A 3-COURSE DINNER & SHOW. Tickets are on sale now at https://www.exploretock.com/southkitchenandjazzphiladelphia/.
