🌟 Excited and looking forward to heading to San Diego this week as part of GPLEX 2024! 🌿✨

I can't wait to connect with innovative minds, explore new ideas, and bring fresh insights back to Philadelphia—especially when it comes to solving food insecurity and creating a stronger local food economy. 🌍🍽️

Stay tuned for updates, and let's continue working together to shape a more sustainable, equitable future!
