When the suits show up AND the substance follows, you know it’s a good night.

Had the pleasure of being in the room where it happened at the Governor’s Reception at none other than the Franklin Institute — and let me just say… it was a powerful event... this is where deals get done/got done.
Big thanks to Governor Josh Shapiro for bringing the insight, inspiration, and real talk — and for making it clear that now is the time for bold leadership and fearless collaboration. 

Grateful for the chance to connect with some heavy hitters from the State and the City — including our good friend Council President Kenyatta Johnson, always bringing that boots-on-the-ground wisdom and vision, George, Dominique, Pat, Porsche, Joe, Andrew, Michael, Larry, among many others. 
Shoutout to the Franklin Institute for setting the stage with class, creativity, and a swanky vibe that felt both timeless and forward-thinking. Philly knows how to throw a party with purpose.

We talked innovation. We talked fairness for all. We talked next steps.

And if you weren’t in the room, don’t worry — the ripple effects are just getting started.
