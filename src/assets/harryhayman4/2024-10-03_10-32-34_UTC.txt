I had the pleasure of visiting Pretty Girls Cook, and it’s an absolute gem! This diversely owned restaurant brings bold, flavorful dishes that truly celebrate Philadelphia’s rich food culture. From the delicious meals to the warm, welcoming vibe, it’s a place you definitely want to check out. As the Sr. Fellow to the Food Economy & Policy, it’s always my pleasure to support and uplift Philadelphia’s local and diverse food economy. Make sure to stop by and experience what Pretty Girls Cook has to offer — you won’t be disappointed!
