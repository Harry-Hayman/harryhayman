#BEHAG My Big Harry Audacious Goal needs you! The Feed Philly Coalition is working on finding land to build an Indoor Agriculture Environment, a specialized form of farming that represents an emergent and rapidly growing field with the potential to reduce many environmental and social challenges facing food, energy, and water. Our vision is to partner with the city to be the first city ever to do it, do it right and use it to feed the city!.

Our #1 goal is to provide healthy fresh vegetables and fruits to underserved communities and those able to purchase them in all parts of the city. Let us know if you know anyone or want to be a part of the BEHAG.
