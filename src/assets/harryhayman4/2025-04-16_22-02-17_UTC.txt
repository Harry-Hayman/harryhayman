HOW DO I KEEP ENDING UP AT BAR HYGGE HAPPY HOUR?

Honestly, I don’t know if it’s gravity, destiny, or just the smell of roasted Brussels and the promise of a damn good bourbon— but somehow, some way, I always find myself back at Bar Hygge... and I’m not mad about it.
✨ Shoutout to the legend who built this neighborhood gem from the ground up — stay hi to Stew if you can - one of those owner's you root for. You’ve created a space that’s warm, welcoming, and dangerously addictive.
That happy hour?

It's infectious

It whispers, “stay for one more…”
And next thing you know, it’s Tuesday and you’re making friends with a brewer and bonding over house pickles.

If you’re looking for a vibe that’s chill but elevated, cozy but alive, with craft beer that hits and food that feels like someone cared — this is your spot.

And if you see me posted up at the bar again this week? Mind your business. Or better yet — pull up a stool and join me.
