"The important thing is to make a different world, to make a world that is not now. A real-world, a genuine world, but one that allows myth to live. Myth is everything." –Sergio Leone⁣
What is your vision of what the world should be?  Every day I strive to make an impact by collaborating and creating a world that allows myths to live.
