I just want to do a quick post to congratulate to my friends Brian, Alex, Ashton, Margo and everyone at SHIFT who are all doing amazing and important work for the community.  Brian is a visionary leader who already has made a difference (and will continue to do so!).
At SHIFT, they are on a mission to create inclusive, equitable communities that thrive. Through our Whole Neighborhood approach, they invest in places AND people to create opportunity and shared prosperity for all. They deploy integrated development strategies that connect the economic and social dots across sectors, partners, and neighborhoods to serve people and, to help create better lives.
