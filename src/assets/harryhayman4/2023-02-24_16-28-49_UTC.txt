Good day - I want to acknowledge my new friend Larry Downey (and the whole team) over at Broad Street Ministries. Larry recently gave me and my Economy League team a tour and schooled us on ALL that they do - amazing. Thank you to Larry and the team over at Broad Street for doing what they do.
#BroadStreetMinistries Broad Street Ministry (BSM) was originally formed in 2005 as an inclusive, alternative worship community, expressing the values of welcome and radical hospitality through weekly meals and camaraderie. Fifteen years later, BSM had grown to welcome more than 400 individuals each weekday for healthful meals, community, and stabilizing services that reduce the trauma of scarcity and poverty.
