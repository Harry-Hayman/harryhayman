My favorite discussion panel and networking event in Philadelphia is next week:

PAGE Summit 2024

Next Thursday,
Feb, 29th 2024

The @economyleague is hosting the 5th annual PAGE Summit.

Because of the overwhelming positive support we get for this event, and last year's huge success, we are hosting this panel once again.

This year at the legendary Belmont Mansion in Fairmount Park.

If you've never been inside the mansion, this is a great time to stop by - you get a tour of the historic museum included with the event if you get here before the show - and you also get to experience the best view of the #philadelphia skyline. 

I will be there among many other prominent leaders in Philadelphia. Who will be discussing - Institutional Procurement, Diversity in Real Estate and Construction, Minority Business Enterprises, and much more.

Come join us to network and learn from each other.

The link to register is in my story.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
