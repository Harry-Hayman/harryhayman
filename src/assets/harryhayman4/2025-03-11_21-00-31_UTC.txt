Another Magical Night at SOUTH Restaurant & Jazz Club! 

Last night was one for the books! The incredible Vanessa Rubin graced the stage with her signature vocals, effortlessly weaving stories through song. Backed by an all-star trio—Brandon McCune on piano, Kenny Davis on bass, and Winard Harper on drums—the music soared, the energy was electric, and the spirit of jazz was alive and thriving. 

SOUTH continues to be the place where jazz legends and rising stars meet, delivering unforgettable nights of music, soul, and connection. If you weren’t there, you missed something special—but don’t worry, there’s always another night to experience the magic!

See you at the next show! #SOUTHJazzClub #LiveJazz #PhillyJazz #VanessaRubin #JazzLegends
