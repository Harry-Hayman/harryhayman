SOMI DIDN’T JUST PERFORM — SHE TRANSCENDED. 

Somi Kakoma didn't give us a concert—she gave us a sacred experience.

- The first African woman ever Grammy-nominated in a jazz category.
- A Tony-nominated force of nature.
- A Doris Duke Artist, two-time NAACP Image Award winner, and rightful queen of vocal storytelling.

Her voice? A velvet thunderstorm.
Her presence? A lesson in grace, power, and purpose.
Her music? Ancestral. Emotional. Alive.

From fan favorites to previews of her new album, every note carried the weight of history and the breath of tomorrow. We didn’t just hear jazz—we felt it. Deep. Soul-deep.

If you were there, you know.
If you missed it…just know the air still hums with what she left behind.

Thank you, Somi. Philly won’t forget.
