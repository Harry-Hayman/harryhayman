@brittanylynnsig To truly know Philadelphia drag; you must consider Brittany Lynn – actor, host supreme, singer, Fancy Brigade parade leader, den mother to an A-Team of local drag performers, and an avatar of the controversial Drag Reading Series, for impressionable kids, in neighboring libraries and schools. For all this, Lynn has been awarded her own day, March 15, from Mayor Jim Kenney, and the City Council cited her efforts in breaking down barriers between our city’s diverse communities and bringing our LGBTQIA community to mainstream constituents in both the Mummers Day New Year’s Day Parade and Independence Day gatherings.” – Philadelphia Weekly 

In 1992, The Chicken Soup Brigade held the first Gay Bingo event hosted by The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an order of queer and trans nuns devoted to “devoted to community service, ministry and outreach to those on the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual enlightenment.” 

The game also provided a social space for HIV fundraising. Gay Bingo brought to bear queerness and games to support those most vulnerable in a political and social climate that marked both LGBTQ people and people living with HIV for death.
