Yesterday was truly a memorable event at Fox Chase Farm as we gathered to celebrate the launch of the Philadelphia School District’s new Equine Assisted Social Emotional Learning Support Program! I was deeply honored to be there and incredibly moved by the inspiring words shared by Dr. Mandy Manna, Superintendent Dr. Watlington, Ms. Smith, Dr. Neree, Dr. Anderson, Merideth Lowe, and Kristin De Marco. A special shoutout goes to 7th-grade student Michael Castillo, who stole the show with his exceptional poise and passion – well done, Michael!

A huge thank you to Dr. Manna for her boundless energy and visionary leadership. This unique program, which focuses on supporting students’ mental health through therapeutic equine interactions, marks a transformative step in addressing critical emotional and social needs within our schools. I look forward to seeing the impact this innovative initiative will have on our students’ lives.
