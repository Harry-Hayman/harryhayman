Just want to take a moment to acknowledge all the Philadelphia winners in the recent James Beard Awards, especially my friend Ellen Yin.⁣
Also honorable mention to my friend Peter Breslow who represents a number of the winners.⁣

Peter Breslow’s drive, determination, and high energy make him a one-of-a-kind maverick in the world of public relations & marketing. One could say that he has ignited serious buzz about himself by obsessing about generating buzz for his clients.⁣
Go, Philly!⁣
