Have to tell you all about an amazing movement that is happening…upcycling food…food rescuing...it has many names. 
For those who know me, they know I have been on this bandwagon for years. While there are many amazing people that are doing wonderful work in this space (shout out to Megha, Food Connect Group!), I want to shine a light on my friend Evan and his company Sharing Excess, who is killing it down at the Philadelphia Whole Sale Produce Market (over 10 MM pounds saved…and given away!). Here I am w/ Evan and Alex from his team.

Upcycling food refers to using edible food that would otherwise have been thrown away. For example, many companies use imperfect fruits and vegetables to produce new food products like veggie chips. Restaurants and cafeterias upcycle food by ensuring that all purchased food is used.

Sharing Excess mission is to bridge the gap between excess and scarcity by partnering with grocery stores, restaurants, wholesalers, and farmers to deliver surplus food to a network of nonprofits, food banks, and community organizations to alleviate local food insecurity.
