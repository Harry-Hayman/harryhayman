Such a great night at The Bank with DAD, BRO and UNC for Orioles & Phillies...and beloved Birds took the contest in an exciting game! Before anyone says anything i.e. Johnny come lately, I said I was a Birds fan loud and proud when we were what 0 and 21 was it? Got my Orioles "City Connect" jersey right before the game and headed in... an honorable mention to the Phils for having a little plant-based action, and the dogs were all that! @orioles

O's drop bold new City Connect jerseys. The caps don’t read “O’s” but rather display a fresh script “B” logo. The jerseys don’t read “Orioles,” but instead “Baltimore.”The Orioles became the 19th MLB team to reveal a City Connect uniform (a rollout by Nike that began in 2021), and the fifth to do so this season.
