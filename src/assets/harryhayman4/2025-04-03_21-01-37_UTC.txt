PHILADELPHIA WAS COOKING!  PUN INTENDED!

This was not just another night/event in the City of Brotherly Love ‚Äî it was a culinary love letter written by the James Beard Foundation and delivered with FIRE (a friend of mine said "it slapped" - which I think is good).
We gathered, we sipped, we savored... and we celebrated the flavors, the talent, and the heart of Philly‚Äôs food scene like NEVER before. From bites that blew our minds to chefs who reminded us why this city is a true gastronomic powerhouse ‚Äî #TasteAmericaPHL was one for the BOOKS. 

I‚Äôm still reeling from: The energy
The company
The cocktails
The food
The mission

This wasn‚Äôt just tasting. This was a movement. A reminder that food is power, and Philly‚Äôs culinary community is leading the charge.

Huge thanks to the @beardfoundation for putting Philly on this incredible national platform ‚Äî and to every chef, bartender, and food lover who showed up and showed OUT.

üìçWhere were you? Because if you missed this‚Ä¶ oof. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôre just getting started.
