Does anyone else miss being able to eat out? More and more restaurants started to open up their outdoor dining areas this month and i’m here for it! Personally, I can’t wait to hit up some of my favorite spots and even try some new food, beer, wine, and cocktails at local joints I haven’t been to before. Who’s with me? #phillydining #Restaurants #Explore #Instafood #foodandwine #eatery #Philadelphia #goodeats #afterquarantine #phillylove
