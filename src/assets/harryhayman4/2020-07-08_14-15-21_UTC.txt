I know we're allowed to go out, but I still want to be careful and not foolish — especially not like other states. Last week we had a business meeting in AC, so we decided, hell — why not hang out! Later we took a stroll along the #boardwalk, by #Tropicana, and by the ocean. @kelseysac @docksoysterhouseac #AC #jerseyshore #jerseyproduce #jerseytomatoes #DocksOysterHouse #KelseysSoulFood #beachday #atlanticocean, #sunset #sunrise #starbucks #summervibes #summer
