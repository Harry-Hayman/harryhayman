What an Unforgettable Night at SOUTH! 

This week, SOUTH was alive with the incredible sounds of jazz legends as the powerhouse Terri Lyne Carrington graced our stage, joined by the immensely talented Christie Dashiell! Part of Gerald Veasley’s “Unscripted” Jazz Series, the night was everything we dreamed of and more—filled with electrifying energy, soul-stirring rhythms, and pure musical magic. 

Terri’s groundbreaking drumming brought the house down, reminding us all why she’s an icon in jazz, while Christie’s mesmerizing vocals captivated every ear in the room. Huge thanks to Gerald Veasley for curating this remarkable series that continues to elevate live jazz and bring together extraordinary talent. We’re beyond grateful to share these unforgettable moments with our SOUTH family.

Stay tuned—because the “Unscripted” series has more surprises ahead. If you weren’t here, you missed something special, but there’s plenty more magic to come!
