🚜 Exploring Kahuku Farms, Hawaii! 🌴✨

This place is next level! 🚀 Took a wagon tour through the farm, learned how bananas, cacao, and acai are grown, and even tried some next-level fresh fruit. 🍌🍫🥭

🔥 Fun Facts:
✅ First farm to grow acai in Hawaii 🍇
✅ Everything in the acai bowl was grown on-site 🌱
✅ Sustainable farming at its best! ♻️

If you’re ever in Oahu, this is a must-visit! 🌺 Who else loves farm-to-table eats? 🍽👇🏾
