I’m excited about the dedication of a new mural honoring American jazz saxophonist and composer John Coltrane. Designed by artist Ernel Martinez, the mural features several moments in the life of the 20th-century musical giant who lived in Philadelphia and whose influence transcends musical styles, genres, and cultural boundaries.
