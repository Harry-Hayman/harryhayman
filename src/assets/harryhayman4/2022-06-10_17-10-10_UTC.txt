Thank you to the Philadelphia Tribune for the great press on the upcoming North Broad Project.⁣
When was the last time you took a tour of Philadelphia?  It’s time…Now that the summer is officially here and events are live.  I’ve been helping behind the scenes as one of the organizers for the North Broad Project.⁣
This summer, Philadelphians will be able to experience a renaissance of augmented reality along North Broad Street.  Starting June 2 and every Thursday through Aug. 25, “Summer a Broad” will offer an interactive experience via ground decals that visitors or residents can check out on smartphones of these five historic North Broad Street locations: The Rail Park (North Broad and Noble streets), The Divine Lorraine Hotel (699 N. Broad St.), The Historic Blue Horizon (1314 N. Broad St.), The Historic Sullivan Progress Plaza (1501 N. Broad St.) and The Uptown Theater (2240 N. Broad St.).⁣
“Summer a Broad” introduced the augmented reality experience that will allow people walking down the street to scan a QR code that will be on the ground decal and experience community vitalization efforts.⁣
Pick a day and make your way to North Broad Street!
