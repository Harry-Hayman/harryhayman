Exciting Trip To DC!

Last Week, I had the privilege of leading a conversation with leaders and emerging leaders from Philadelpha about the Philadelphia Food Economy as part of The Economy League of Greater Philadelphiaâ€™s EGLE tour.

Our destination on this leg of the tour was the incredible DC Central Kitchen (DCCK).

Civic engagement is crucial for driving positive change, and DCCK exemplifies this through their amazing work in fighting hunger and empowering the community. Their innovative approach not only provides meals but also offers culinary job training, creating a sustainable impact.
Proud to witness and support such transformative efforts!
