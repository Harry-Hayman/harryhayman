Flashback Fridays!
Someone asked me the other day if I played tennis, and I said HELL YEAH! And then they asked me if I was any good (b/c I am old and decrepit now) and I said, in fact, I was…ranked #13 in the MIDDLE STATES Bitch! I also won the Martin’s Dam Tennis tourney w/ my DAD in 83…okay now! You ain’t never lied!
