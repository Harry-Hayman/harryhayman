Such an amazing weekend at the club…first of all, the nicest people in the world, and then on top of that, damn near the most talented (if not)…and an amazing story to boot. SOUTH presented Chein Chein Lu & Richie Good’s “Connected” featuring J. Hoard. Born out of hard time in our country (the pandemic, Asian hate crimes, the events that led to Black Lives Matter, etc), something beautiful was created…to use the words of J. Michael Harrison…”a gem,” and it truly is. @richiegoods @chienchienluvibes

 Chien Chien Lu is a jazz vibraphonist, contemporary percussionist, and composer from Taiwan. She recorded on trumpeter Jeremy Pelt's latest record, “Jeremy Pelt The Artist,” and toured with the band to France, Poland, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, and UK. Chien Chien has recently stepped forth as a composer and leader with her own quartet.

 The youngest person ever inducted into the Pittsburgh Jazz Hall of Fame, bassist Richie Goods got an early start playing in church and clubs while still attending Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts High School. Richie got the attention of many in the jazz community and afforded him the opportunity to record and tour with a variety of jazz and popular artists ranging from the DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Whitney Houston and Christina Aguilera. Richie’s lengthy discography also includes Grammy award-winning and platinum albums of Alicia Keys and Common.

The debut project from the ensemble known as Connected is fronted by the gifted bassist Richie Goods and the rising star vibraphonist/percussionist Chien Chien Lu. The project was formed during the pandemic while they were in lockdown together.
