Excited to attend the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia’s first GPLEX360 screening of 2024 – “Pardon Me” on January 23rd at West Philadelphia Skills Initiative!

“Pardon Me” is a powerful documentary shedding light on the transformative impact of pardons, offering individuals a chance to thrive and contribute to their communities. The film explores how this initiative can uplift lower-income areas, fostering growth and empowerment.

Join me in attending this thought-provoking 30-minute screening, followed by a conversation with the director and experts in the pardon space. Let’s dive into the challenges and opportunities in the Philadelphia area, and explore how we can make a positive impact together.

Did you know the U.S. has the highest number of citizens with criminal records globally? It’s time to address this issue and work towards building stronger, more inclusive communities. By attending, we support the dialogue on reforming the pardon process and creating opportunities for those seeking a fresh start.

Let’s come together to learn, discuss, and contribute to the change we want to see. See you there!
