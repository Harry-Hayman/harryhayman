The Shared Food Program is an organization I volunteer to help provide the Philadelphia region with no-cost food to those in need. Shared Food Program is always looking for volunteers. There are many ways you can volunteer to help. A few hours of your time can make a massive difference to neighbors in need. I will be attending their annual Share’s Party in the Warehouse. If you’re interested, save the date:  10/12/22 and go to the website to become a volunteer or share information with anyone you know who needs food. https://www.sharefoodprogram.org/
