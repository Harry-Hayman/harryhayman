When the Spirit of Nina Simone Took the Stage... 

What happened at SOUTH Restaurant & Jazz Club wasn’t just a concert—it was a summoning.
Bass legend Gerald Veasley and the incomparable Coral Riddick (under Aaron Graves' musical direction) didn’t just perform—they channeled the raw, radical, and righteous power of Nina Simone herself. The room pulsed with purpose. Voices hushed. Glasses clinked in reverence. Every note, every silence, was a revolution in rhythm.

“Feeling Good”? More like feeling transcendental. 

From the thunder of “Sinnerman” to the aching beauty of “I Loves You, Porgy,” Coral’s voice didn’t sing about Nina—she became Nina. And Gerald? He laid down the kind of bass lines that don’t just support a song…they anchor souls.

And yes—it was all being recorded. So if you missed it? Don’t say we didn’t warn you (you 100% can't say that!). History just happened at SOUTH. Again.
