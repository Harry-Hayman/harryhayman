In honor of World Music Day (I know, I know, it was yesterday), but I missed it…and my trip to NYC…here are some photos of The Yellow Jackets at the world-famous Birdland!

World Music Day is celebrated on 21 June every year to honor music's spirit and significance. Professional and amateur musicians come together to perform concerts for the public. 

The Importance of Music. Many bodies of research support the healing effects of music. Our favorite melodies release dopamine, known as the feel-good hormone, which activates our brain’s pleasure and reward system. Music can have a positive, immediate impact on our mental state; fast tempos can psychologically and physiologically arouse us, helping energize us for the day.

YELLOW JACKETS ARE: Russell Ferrante: Piano & Synthesizers, Bob Mintzer: Woodwinds & EWI Will Kennedy: Drums, Dane Alderson: Bass. 

Throughout their storied 43-year history, the Yellowjackets have recorded 25 albums, received 17 Grammy® nominations – won 2 – performed countless sold-out tours, and enjoyed worldwide critical acclaim and commercial success.

About Birdland: Since 1949, Birdland has established itself as an essential part of New York City culture and musical history. Over the past two decades, Birdland has expanded it’s musical outreach with the Broadway at Birdland concert series. And the 2018 addition of the state-of-the-art Birdland Theater has made it possible to include Broadway superstars, burlesque, comedy, cabaret divas, jazz legends and the most buzzed-about up-and-comers to our schedule.
