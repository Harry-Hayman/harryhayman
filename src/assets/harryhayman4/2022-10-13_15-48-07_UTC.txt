October 11th was International Day of the Girl! In honor of International Day of the Girl, Michelle Obama launched the Girls Opportunity Alliance campaign. The Get Her There campaign is a global call to action. We know that none of us can do this work alone. Over the next five years, we aim to come together with brands, nonprofits, and people worldwide to support hundreds of community-led organizations, reaching thousands of adolescent girls—meeting them exactly where they are to get them where they want to be. I hope you’ll join us in this work.⁣

They are doing some great work and are looking for support. If you believe in the work and want to help give our girls the opportunities they deserve, you can get involved here. https://www.obama.org/girlsopportunityalliance/⁣
