Attending the 6th Annual PAGE Summit at @OICPhiladelphia was an inspiring experience. The event's theme, "Leveraging Institutional Power: Business Growth = Jobs Growth," resonated deeply with our mission at the @EconomyLeague.

The evening began with a heartfelt tribute to Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, honoring his enduring legacy of empowerment and self-help. Rev. Sullivan's pioneering efforts, such as founding the Opportunities Industrialization Centers (OIC) in 1964 and establishing Progress Plaza—the nation's first Black-owned shopping center—have left an indelible mark on Philadelphia and beyond.

Engaging in expert panel discussions provided valuable insights into creating equitable and inclusive supply chains. These conversations underscored the importance of collective accountability and the role of public policy in driving sustainable economic growth.

Networking with regional business and civic leaders was a highlight, reinforcing our shared commitment to fostering inclusive prosperity for Philadelphia's local businesses. The unveiling of the Procurement Guidebook stands as a testament to our collective efforts to advance local business opportunities.

 As the Sr. Fellow to Food Economy & Policy and a board member of the @EconomyLeague, I am proud to be part of an organization that continues to champion equitable economic development. Together, we are building upon Rev. Sullivan's legacy, striving to create a more inclusive and prosperous future for all.
