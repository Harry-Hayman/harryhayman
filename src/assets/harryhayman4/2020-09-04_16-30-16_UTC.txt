This #pandemic has affected countless #Philadelphia businesses, causing many of them to close their doors. Unfortunately, Warmdaddy’s is now one of them. Since I opened the #restaurant in 1995, we’ve had some of the greatest #blues acts, live R&B, and wonderful #soulfood. It’s a shame to see the lights go out, but we’re continuing to serve locals out of our SOUTH #jazz kitchen. #shutdown #localbusinesses #Phillyrestaurants #covid19 #foodie #warmdaddys #foodanddrink
