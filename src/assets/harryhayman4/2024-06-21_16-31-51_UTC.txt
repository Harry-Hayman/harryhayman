We are honored to work with @Jeff Jones, an incredibly inspirational man with an amazing story.

He’s joining our team to help implement solutions for food insecurity in Philadelphia. 

Jeffrey has experienced food insecurity firsthand and brings a wealth of knowledge, passion, and dedication to our cause.

We just interviewed Jeffrey for the documentary “I Am Hungry: The Many Faces of Food Insecurity.” – these are some photos from the shoot.  @iamhungryinphiladelphia 

His journey and insights will undoubtedly inspire and shed light on the urgent need to address food insecurity in our community and you will have to watch the documentary to see why we chose this location (and the meaning behind his sign).

Stay tuned for more updates and be sure to follow our journey as we work together to make a meaningful impact!
