Teambuilding dinner with the ELGP team last night at Animae in San Diego! 🍽️✨

We had an incredible evening at Animae, a stunning restaurant offering a modern twist on Asian cuisine, with bold flavors and beautiful presentation. Located in the heart of San Diego, Animae is known for its vibrant atmosphere and creative dishes that blend tradition with innovation.

A few standout dishes that we couldn’t get enough of:

Fire Roasted Cabbage – perfectly charred, with smoky and savory notes that left us wanting more. 🌿🔥
Sweet and Sour Cauliflower – a delightful mix of crispy and tangy goodness, a true crowd-pleaser! 🌶️🍽️
To top it off, we sipped on the refreshing Mango Royale, a tropical drink that brought the perfect balance of sweetness and zest to the evening. 🍹✨

Big thanks to the Animae team for making the night unforgettable. It was a fantastic way to bond and kick off our time together. Looking forward to more moments like this! #ELGP #TeamDinner #AnimaeSD #SanDiegoEats #Foodie
