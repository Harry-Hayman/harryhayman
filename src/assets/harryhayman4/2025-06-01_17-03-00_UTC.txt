Before I skipped town for the weekend, I had the honor of sitting in the presence of the incomparable Cecily at SOUTH Restaurant & Jazz Club — and let me tell you, the room didn’t just listen, it felt.

Her show, “Music of Love and Freedom,” couldn’t have come at a more timely moment — a reminder, through song, of the tenderness that sustains us and the liberation we all deserve.
Her voice? Velvet with purpose.
Her presence? Radiant and rooted.
Her message? Urgent, healing, and needed right now.

Cecily doesn’t just sing — she creates sacred space.
She gives you R&B with depth, soul with substance, and a sound that leaves you both stirred and stilled.

And SOUTH? The perfect setting — where every note bounces off walls steeped in legacy, where the food feeds the body and the music feeds the soul. It’s not just a jazz club, it’s a cultural cornerstone.

Love.
Freedom.
Good food, strong drinks, and real art.

If you were there, you know.
If you weren’t — don’t miss her next time.
