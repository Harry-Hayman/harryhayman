Why do people #giveback to their #community? My “why” is because it’s the right thing to do. Everyone deserves a break sometimes, and so many people in Philadelphia are put in difficult situations that are out of their control. Over the years, I have participated in many forms of community involvement, including a number of speaking engagements, the Feed Philly Coalition and The Philadelphia Jazz Experience, which I founded and created. What are you doing for your community?
