Who's ready to network? I will attend ImpactPHL's Investors Circle happy hour on Wednesday, September 14th, at 5 pm. The event is free; join us for a drink to reflect, celebrate, meet new friends, and reconnect with old ones.⁣
⁣
This happy hour welcomes the impact community - impact investors, philanthropists, financial⁣
professionals, social entrepreneurs, and others who want to align financial⁣
assets with values to build a more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient regional economy.⁣
