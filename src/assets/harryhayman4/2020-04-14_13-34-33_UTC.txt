What I miss the most being #quarantined? I miss being able to work on the Feed Philly Coalition. The goal of our organization is to feed individuals in Philadelphia who are suffering from food insecurity through food upcycling. Learn more about our mission and join our causeâ€¦ Because nobody deserves to go without a meal. #feedphillycoalition #donation #feedthehungry #Phillylove
