🎥 Exciting News! Our projects are making waves—got a chance to chat with a top Philly production company! 🎬 They’re interested in two of our passion projects:
1️⃣ An Appetite for Destruction – a raw, semi-autobiographical look at the highs and lows of the hospitality industry.
2️⃣ Triple A – the inspiring true story of the Intermediate League, dedicated to inclusivity in youth sports.

Every project we work on is about giving back. Let’s make a difference together! 💪 Stay tuned for more updates. 🙏
