What's the dill with Planted Detroit?⁣
Vertical farming. Biosecurity. Controlled Environment Agriculture. They sound like buzzwords from the campaign trail, but they're real practices we're putting to use every day. After gathering a group of plant nerds, IT geeks, grocery gurus, and food lovers, we set out to grow fresh, nutritious greens all year long on Detroit's east side.  https://planteddetroit.com/⁣

Indoor growing is an expanding agriculture sector and demand for indoor growing of more nutritious greens. You should know how I feel about Indoor AG; I've been learning a lot and am eager to get started in our communities.
