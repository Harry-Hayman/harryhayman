GPLEX Day #3: A Day of Bonding, Exploration, and Italian Vibes 🇮🇹

What an incredible day of connection, exploration, and insightful conversations at GPLEX! We spent the day diving into deep topics and building bonds that will last a lifetime.

Our walking tour and then back again later in the day through Little Italy was a highlight—complete with street art, vibrant culture, and, of course, the sights, sounds, and flavors of the Italian Heritage Month street festival! 🎨🍦🍝

Bonus: We indulged in some delicious gelato, a bit of vino during the day (shh, don’t tell anyone!), and enjoyed some authentic pasta to fuel our conversations. 

Grateful for the chance to share this special part of San Diego with our group. Days may be blending together, but the connections and memories will last far longer.
