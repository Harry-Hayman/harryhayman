“Recognize that every interaction you have is an opportunity to make a positive impact on⁣
others.” Shep Hyken.⁣
⁣
One of the reasons I continue to get out in the community and get involved with social⁣
impact is making sure I live my life to impact others positively by implementing programs that help with sustainability or volunteering with organizations that continue to push to assist our communities.⁣
