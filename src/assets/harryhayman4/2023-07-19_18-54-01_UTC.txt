I am really hoping the weather cooperates so we can make it to this event tonight. Just want to acknowledge all my friends over at the Mann for doing this and the great job they do in general...Toby, Catherine, Larry, David (I'm sure I am missing some), and it's been a great venue and important part of my life for as long as I can remember...I think there are still tickets available too!
