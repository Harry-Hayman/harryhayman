Looking forward to joining my wonderful friend and old neighbor, Tony Campolo and his lovely wife, Peggy at this event. Tony and Peggy could not have been nicer to me growing up...and Tony used to include me when he had events at Eastern College (now University)
Tony Campolo is professor emeritus of sociology at Eastern University and a former faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania. For 40 years, he led the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education, an organization which he founded to create and support programs serving needy communities.
Eastern University is a nationally-recognized Christian university enrolling approximately 5,700 students in a wide array of undergraduate, graduate, professional, seminary, and online programs. 
The Campolo Center for Ministry is Tony Campoloâ€™s vision for Christian leadership development and church renewal for the rising generation. Tony is mobilizing a movement to seek out the best and brightest young Christian leaders and to provide training and resources to help them transform the Church.
