I had the honor of stepping inside a place where dignity, hope, and humanity are alive and thriving—
St. John’s Hospice.

From the moment I walked through the doors, I felt it—the quiet, relentless heartbeat of service. I had the privilege of touring the facility, meeting the staff, listening to stories that both humbled and inspired me, and witnessing firsthand the beautiful, necessary work being done there every day.

In a city that’s too often hardened by its own struggle, St. John’s is a sanctuary—feeding, clothing, sheltering, and lifting up our most vulnerable neighbors. But they do so much more than meet basic needs—they restore worth, trust, and hope.

A massive THANK YOU to Kris and her extraordinary team, who show up for all of us by showing up for those who are too often forgotten. Your work is holy. Your commitment is contagious. And your compassion? It’s a reminder that we all have a role to play in building a more just and loving Philadelphia.

If you're looking to witness grace in action, look no further than St. John’s Hospice.
Let’s support them however we can.
