PHER. SHOWED. OUT. 
This weekend at SOUTH, we didn’t just get a performance—we got a soul revival.

Pher didn’t take the stage… he took us to church, to the cookout, to the vinyl section at your uncle’s house—all in one set.

And then—he hit us with a Marvin Gaye tribute.
Yeah. That happened.
And when it did? Time stopped.
It was a full-circle, goosebumps-on-your-goosebumps kind of moment.

It wasn’t just music—it was medicine.
He didn’t just honor Marvin… he channeled him.

If you were there, you know.

If you weren’t? Start praying he comes back soon.

And shout out to Steve McKie - grammy-nominated producer and drummer from Philadelphia and for his collaborations with artists like Jill Scott, Jazmine Sullivan, and Bilal.
