What I have been up to Wednesdays – We all have limited dollars right? Why not do some good w/ them while enjoying yourself along the way? At least, that’s my motto! Support oyster farmers who are having a tough go of it. I’m even looking into supporting an oyster farm in Maryland! This particular batch was from Island Creek Oysters — you can visit them at islandcreekoysters.com — and with that, I'm showing my support for small growers like Joly Oysters from Dennis, MA, for Father’s Day. #oysters #oysterfarmer #seafood #foodie #instafood #oystergram #omega #rawbar #humpday #wednesday
