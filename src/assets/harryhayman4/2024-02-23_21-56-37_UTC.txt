Controlled environment agriculture is my driving force these past few years. 

I am doing anything and everything I can, to bring more food in to the city for people who need it. One of the best ways to do this is through controlled agriculture, so we can start growing food ourselves. 

I have been working with the School District of Philadelphia and Dr. Mandy Manna to bring agriculture and sustainability awareness to our next generation.

If you want to fight beside us, and bring more food to Philadelphia to those who need it - then get in contact with me and we can make great things happen!
