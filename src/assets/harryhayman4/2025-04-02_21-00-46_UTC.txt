Tipsy Womenâ€™s History Delivered the Vibes!

The 3rd Annual GPLEX360 Tipsy Women's History event was nothing short of EPIC â€” a dazzling blend of inspiration, laughter, community, and unapologetic celebration! From start to finish, it was a masterclass in how to make history come alive. 

This wasnâ€™t just an event. It was a movement. A vivid tribute to the bold, brilliant, trailblazing women who shaped our region and beyond â€” with this yearâ€™s powerful theme, Women and Health, hitting all the right notes. The stories shared? Iconic. The vibes? Immaculate. The impact? Unforgettable.

We are sending a HUGE acknowledgement to Kejsi â€” a force of nature, a visionary, and an absolute superstar.  Your leadership, energy, and passion were the heartbeat of this experience.

And to the entire Economy League staff â€” YOU. DID. THAT. From the details to the storytelling, to the inclusive and electric energy in the room â€” you knocked it out of the park. Again.

Tipsy Womenâ€™s History isnâ€™t just an event â€” itâ€™s a space where HERstory is honored, reimagined, and amplified. Thank you for creating a space that was part celebration, part education, and all inspiration.

Already counting down to next year. Letâ€™s keep making history together. ðŸ–¤ðŸ‘‘ðŸ”¥
