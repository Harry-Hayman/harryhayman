Another successful GPLEX 2022 Cohort Networking Happy Hour. I had a great time hanging with J'nelle Larence of the Economy League.  We had a chance to meet the other GPLEX Cohort before our trip to Detroit coming up in October.⁣
⁣
GPLEX 360. was born out of the desire to create a home for ongoing cohort connections and experiences. A once-a-year meeting of the minds. The Greater Philadelphia Leadership Exchange is an initiative of the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia to develop leaders of business, civic, and government organizations into visionaries dedicated to making Greater Philadelphia a national powerhouse.⁣
