What an incredible day at the Sanctuary Farms 3rd Annual Community Fall Festival! Being at 24th St. & Berks St. in the heart of Philadelphia last weekend, I was reminded of just how important events like this are to the very fabric of our city. 

Sanctuary Farms is doing remarkable work, not only by promoting urban farming and community wellness but by truly bringing people together. This festival was a perfect blend of local vendors, amazing food, fun activities, and a real sense of community. 

Organizations like Sanctuary Farms—and others like them—are essential to the health and spirit of Philadelphia. They serve as pillars of our neighborhoods, providing resources, education, and opportunities for connection. We need more of this kind of grassroots action to ensure our city thrives and that everyone has access to fresh, healthy food. 

Thanks to everyone who came out —let’s keep supporting the causes that matter most!
