Turning Surplus into Solutions – The Future of Food Starts NOW! 

What if I told you that tons of perfectly good tomatoes—destined for the landfill—could be transformed into a game-changing, locally-produced products that feed our community AND strengthens Philadelphia’s food economy? Well… it’s happening.

I’m beyond excited to share the work with Sharing Excess, Drexel Food Lab, and The Economy League—where we’re taking rescued fruits and vegetables and creating something BIG. We’re talking upcycled tomato products that could rival the bulk products currently being imported from outside of PA.  Why should Philly send billions of food dollars OUT of our city when we can create viable, scalable, locally-sourced solutions RIGHT HERE?! 🍅🏙️

✨ WHY THIS MATTERS:
✅ Fights Food Waste – We’re rescuing perfectly good produce and giving it new life.
✅ Supports Philly’s Food Economy – Keeping dollars local, instead of relying on national supply chains.
✅ Creates Cost-Effective Solutions – Affordable, high-quality products for anchor institutions, schools, hospitals, and food banks.
✅ Brings Innovation to the Table – Imagine high-quality, chef-driven, locally-sourced tomato products replacing generic, mass-produced versions.

And guess what? This is more than just an idea—this is a movement. 🌍

If you care about food justice, sustainability, and making real economic impact in Philadelphia, let’s connect. This project has the potential to change the way we think about food waste and local food production—and we’re just getting started. 

 Philly is building its own food future—who’s in?  Kudos to all the great work Evan is already doing at Sharing Excess and Jon over at the Drexel Food Lab!  Mad Love for them!
