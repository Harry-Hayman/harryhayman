Very cool meeting last week with Scott Erdy – I followed GPS, and I was like, this can’t be right, but it was – this very, very cool space in Fishtown where he and his fellow architectural savants hang out – we were meeting at the behest of Dickson Despommier to talk about the future of buildings, cities, you name it that are genuinely, truly sustainable.⁣⁣

I had no idea the breadth and depth of this man’s work – see some here:  https://oroeditions.com/product/erdy-mchenry-architecture⁣⁣

Scott’s work pursues a methodology where form embodies purpose and a sense of place is revealed through the careful intersection of program, site, and culture. Since establishing Erdy McHenry Architecture with David McHenry, Scott’s design work has received many accolades from the local and national press as well as his peers and has received more than 30 state, local and national awards.⁣⁣
⁣
We are hoping to work with Scott and his firm as we look to “future proof” Philly…stay tuned!⁣⁣
