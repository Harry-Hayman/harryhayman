üçï Down North Pizza is hands down one of the best spots in Philly for za that hits the mark EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Their pizza is dynamite‚Äîand yes, even their vegan options taste like the real deal!  Ask me how I know!

But what makes Down North even more incredible is their mission. They‚Äôre not just serving up delicious pies, they‚Äôre reinvesting in the community by providing jobs and training to formerly incarcerated individuals.  They‚Äôre proving that you can make a real difference while serving up some of the best food in the city.

Let‚Äôs show them some love and continue to support local spots that are making a positive impact!  #PhillyEats #SupportLocal #DownNorthPizza #PizzaWithPurpose #HarryHaymanPhiladelphia
