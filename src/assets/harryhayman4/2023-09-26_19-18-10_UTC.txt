I was able to make it over to World Café Live on Saturday Night and experience an Unforgettable Night of Jazz with the incomparable @kurtelling⁣
⁣
Kurt Elling was in top form and was mesmerizing, and he had with/ him the virtuosity of Charlie Hunter on guitar, the infectious grooves of The Huntertones on the brass, and the exceptional jazz stylings of Julius Rodriguez on the keys – all-star band to boot!⁣
⁣
The energy in the room was palatable, and the music... it touched the soul in ways words can't describe. It's moments like these that remind us of the sheer power of live music and its ability to unite people through melody and rhythm.⁣

Special acknowledgements to Hal, Kerry, Rob and the entire staff at World Café Live. Let us continue to celebrate the beauty of jazz and keep the music alive!⁣
