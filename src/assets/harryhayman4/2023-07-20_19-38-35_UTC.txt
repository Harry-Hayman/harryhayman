Such an exciting night at The Kimmel Cultural Campus on Friday night - if you have not been yet to see Moulin Rouge (or any of the other great shows being presented), you should.

Everything You Need To Know About Moulin Rouge (The Musical Part At least) Moulin Rouge! The Musical is set in the bohemian mecca of Montmartre in Paris, France, during a period called La Belle Ã‰poque at the turn of the twentieth century. The story follows an aspiring American writer and composer named Christian, who has landed in Paris in search of inspiration.
