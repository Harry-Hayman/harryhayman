It’s not often that I share my accomplishments, but I wanted to share that I recently completed Business Strategies For Social Impact at the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Business | Philadelphia, PA.  I share because my work with social impact is important to me, and I’m dedicated to learning what I can to continue to make a difference.
