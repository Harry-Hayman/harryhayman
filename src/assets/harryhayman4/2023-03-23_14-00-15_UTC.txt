The Office of Arts, Culture, and the Creative Economy (OACCE) invites you to join us as we kick off Philly Celebrates Jazz by attempting to set a new world record for the number of people doing jazz hands at once. Join #OACCE at LOVE Park at 12 p.m. (noon) on March 28, 2023, to be pictured in the record-setting photo alongside Mayor Jim Kenney.⁣
The event will also feature live music performed by #localjazzband #Mobbluz and the announcement of OACCE’s Philly Celebrates Jazz 2023 calendar of jazz-inspired events during the month of April. Arrive early to get complimentary white jazz gloves to wear in the photo.⁣
