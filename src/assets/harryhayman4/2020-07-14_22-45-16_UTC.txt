Who’s ready for a summer of Brotherly Love? I can’t get enough of #Philadelphia — and I’m so glad to see a lot of attractions are starting to open up with the proper precautions in place. Places like the Independence Seaport Museum, the Waterfront at Spruce Street Harbor Park, and the PHS Pop Up Garden at South Street are all open for the season. Check em’ out! #summervibes #summer #quarantine #pandemic #philly #phillylove #explore #travel #museums #waterfront #sprucestreet #instagood
