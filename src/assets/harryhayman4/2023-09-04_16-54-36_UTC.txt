Happy Labor Day and Greetings from Sea Isle City New Jersey
Labor Day weekend in Sea Isle City - always a good time!
Riding waves, body surfed, and read on the beach.
Long walks (and jogs) on the beach
Local food from Mike’s, Marie’s, The Dunes and others!  (Miss you Nicklebee’s)
Checked out ocean sunrises and bay sunsets
Live music and entertainment a must!
Sea Isle City, thanks for being you!
