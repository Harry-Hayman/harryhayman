Took the backroads to Sea Isle this weekend and made my mandatory stop at one of my all-time favorite hidden gems: Sweet Amalia Market & Kitchen in Newfield, NJ. If you know, you KNOW.

994 Route 40, Newfield, NJ — drop a pin, set an alert, make the detour.

This place isn’t just a pit stop — it’s a James Beard–nominated culinary experience disguised as a seafood shack with soul. Chef Melissa McGrath is out here serving oysters that could make Poseidon weep, plus seasonal dishes so fresh they taste like they were whispered into existence by the Garden State herself.

Oysters? Unreal.
Seasonal plates? Farmstand meets fine dining.
Vibes? Indoor/outdoor, laid back but chef’s kiss level quality.

If you’re headed to the beach (Sea Isle, Wildwood, whatever), this is your pre-sand pilgrimage. Hit it Thursday through Sunday, 11AM–7PM — they're seasonal, so don’t sleep.

Go to the beach — but stop here first.
