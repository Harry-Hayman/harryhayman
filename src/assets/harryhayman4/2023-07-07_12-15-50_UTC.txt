Pontificating life and hanging with my friend @farmerjawn Christa, aka FarmerJawn, at this year’s WaWa Welcome to America Street Festival

 Wawa Welcome America, Philadelphia's Independence Day festival, on the Fourth of July weekend with a series of concerts and special events, including a block party on the Avenue of the Arts.

Hosted by PNC and Kimmel Cultural Campus, the block party returned to South Broad Street People of all ages listened to live performers, watched a preview of the Kimmel Center's upcoming shows, and shopped for fresh produce.

Farmer Jawn is a Black AND woman-led organization that is doing something that’s never been done with our 128 acres of land. We are growing food and educating the next BIPOC farmers of America and growing organic food for all because you deserve chemical free at a fair price!

We are deeply committed to the health of both people and the planet. When you choose us, you're part of a historic movement, transforming 'food is medicine' from a mere phrase to a practical reality. Support FarmerJawn, support your health, and make a stand for a sustainable future."

Honorable mention to Mia Ormes from Tribu @mealsbytribu I highly recommend the Gumbo, @spottedhorseprovisions Spotted Horse Provisions all the pestos are amazing, and to Native Sun Co @nativesuncompanies for their herbal tea, Philadelphia Tropical Treats @phillytropicaltreats for something coconutty and sweet and all the vendors that participated…what a great day for one and all.
