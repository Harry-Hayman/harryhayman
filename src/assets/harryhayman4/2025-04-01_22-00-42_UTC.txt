KIM TUCKER — A PHILLY’S JAZZ HERO!

If Philly jazz had a heartbeat, her name would be Kim Tucker. She’s the voice behind the scenes, the hand lifting others up, and the soul holding it all together.

When our city’s musicians were out of work, out of options, or out of time—Kim showed up. When a beloved jazz artist passed without family or funds, Kim made sure they had dignity in death. And when artists needed help with housing, insurance, or just a lifeline? They called Kim. Always.

And now—FINALLY—the world is catching up.
The Jazz Journalists Association has named Kim Tucker the official JAZZ HERO OF PHILADELPHIA. 🔥
Award. Unquestionably. Deserved.

Come celebrate her legacy on Tuesday, April 15 at 7PM at Settlement Music School, Germantown — the perfect setting for a woman who has devoted her life to making sure the music never stops.

From jazz breakfasts in Mt. Airy to mentoring through Jazz Bridge, from playing organ at 11 to organizing tributes for legends like Bootsie Barnes, Kim lives and breathes the music—and the people who make it.

👑 We don’t throw this word around often, but here it is:
ICON.
Thank you, Kim, for making sure Philly’s jazz family is never left behind.
