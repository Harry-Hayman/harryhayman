## In Addition to His Professional Background...

Harry’s family has also played an important role in his life.

Harry Hayman IV was born in Washington DC to his parents, Robin and Harry III. With his father being an international banker, young Harry soon became accustomed to traveling the world extensively, moving from Maryland to Virginia to New Jersey to Venezuela to Mexico to London to Germany to New York City and many places in between.

Harry grew up with two younger siblings: a sister, Kimberly, with whom he is still close to this day, and a brother, Brad. Kimberly was married in 1997 and eventually gave birth to Harry’s three nephews and nieces, Jackson, Ella, and Reed. Brad and Harry were also close, despite a gap in age, but Brad tragically passed away due to heart complications as a teenager, while Harry was in his mid-twenties. After his passing, the family started the Hayman Family Fund in Brad’s name and honor.

Harry is currently unmarried but is involved in a serious relationship with his current girlfriend. She has accompanied him to various outings supporting the arts, as well as at his numerous speaking engagements and other professional appearances. She is also actively involved in many of his charitable donations.

Harry Hayman remains very close with his family to this day. He still makes it a point to see his mother, his uncles, John and Jim, and the rest of his family on a regular basis. He especially enjoys visiting them and cooking for them. There are few things more important to Harry than his family, with his family values being an inspiration for all of this past, present, and future endeavors. His upbringing and background have played a substantial part in molding Harry into the man he is today.

## Harry’s Early Career

From an early age, Harry Hayman knew he wanted to be an entrepreneur. At age 17, he got his foot in the door of the bar business as a dish-washer in Washington, DC. Within the next couple of years, he would rise through the ranks and work just about every job you could think of in a bar. By 19, he was expediting. That same year, he also started Presto! Design, marketing special events at local bars and restaurants.

While gaining real-world experience working in bars, he also pursued more traditional education. After attending Radnor High School, and then The American University (where he earned a B.A. in International Business and Finance), he wanted to prove to himself and others that he could get into the prestigious Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia.

He did.
