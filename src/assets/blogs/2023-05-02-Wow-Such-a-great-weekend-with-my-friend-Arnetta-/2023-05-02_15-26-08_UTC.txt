Wow!  Such a great weekend with my friend Arnetta and 4 SOLD OUT Shows at SOUTH Restaurant & Jazz Club - a great, tight band with Henry, Dan, Lenny, and all.  For those who don't know about Arnetta and her style of jazz, which she calls "disruptive jazz," you really should.⁣
“Disrupter of Jazz” because she wants to disrupt everything you think of when you hear the word Jazz.  Arnetta Johnson didn’t realize when she first picked up the trumpet at age 13 that the instrument would open doors and take her around the world. Growing up in Camden. NJ Johnson studied, practiced, and shed until her instrument became an extension of herself as she became better known as “That Trumpet Chic.” Some of her most notable achievements include performing alongside Beyoncé during her guest appearance in the Super Bowl LVIII (50) and her iconic “Homecoming” performance at Coachella in 2018. Johnson is also listed as a featured trumpeter on the 2018 “OTR II Tour” as well as the 2018 Grammy Award-winning album The Carters “Everything Is Love.”⁣
