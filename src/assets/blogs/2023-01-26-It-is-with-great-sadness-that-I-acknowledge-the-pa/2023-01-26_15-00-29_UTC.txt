It is with great sadness that I acknowledge the passing of a friend - he was everyone's friend, but I had the pleasure and honor of first meeting Jerry through Kenny Gamble many, many years ago and then seeing him a lot in old City.  I remember one breezy summer day sitting outside of High Street @highstreet @fork, one of Ellen's wonderful spots, and we had a few glasses of chard together and just talked about life...R.I..P. my friend⁣
