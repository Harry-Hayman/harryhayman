Talk about a man with a plan…I was blown away by (new friend) David and his vision for his company, Horn & Hardart…that is right, that Horn & Hardart…we’re bringing it back, baby! For real, this time…you heard it here first…it makes so much sense…people love ironic brands with rich histories and stories and the manner of service makes even more sense now than ever before. That, along with the legitimate history of social impact, this company is poised to do amazing things.

 Horn and Hardart opened the first Automat in Philadelphia at 818 Chestnut Street in 1902. It was an instant phenomenon that would last nearly a hundred years. Fun facts about the Automat, an iconic waiter-less restaurant concept that was popular in Philadelphia. The Automat revisits the iconic restaurant chain using vintage photographs, film reels, and interviews with former Horn & Hardart (or as Philadelphians affectionately call it, H&H) employees and famous customers such as Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Colin Powell.

Joseph Horn had traveled to Europe and experienced the revolutionary new form of restaurant known as the Automat, pioneered by Max Sielaff in Berlin. Inspired by the success and decor of this new form of food service that eliminated wait staff but still served high-quality fresh food, Horn persuaded his partner Frank Hardart to open the first automat in the U.S., which made its debut on June 9, 1902, at 818 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. It was the first non-European restaurant to receive patented vending machines from Sielaff's Automat GmbH factory in Berlin, the creators also of the first chocolate bar vending machine for Ludwig Stollwerck
