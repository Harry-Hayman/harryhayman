Got rocked by a BBQ revelation my brother put me on to — ZIG~ZAG BBQ — and let me tell you, this ain’t your average brisket and beans joint. This is smoked soul with swagger. 
The owner’s from Baltimore — so you already know, we’re talking kindred spirits here. Grit. Grind. Good food that doesn’t apologize for what it is. This is BBQ for the bold.

Now, full disclosure — vegan options? Not really. This place is meat-forward with no shame in its game. But if you believe in supporting the local food economy, the culture of neighborhood flavor, and small business dreams built on smoke and hustle — Zig Zag BBQ deserves your dollars. 💪🏾💥

Salute to spots like this that keep the streets savory. #SupportLocal #NeighborhoodEats #BBQTruthSerum #ZigZagBBQ #BaltimoreMeetsPhilly #MeatSweatsAndPride #HarryWasHere #FeedTheCityRight #LocalFoodEconomy
