Exciting Ventures Unveiled! 

Last week brought together an incredible blend of talent and passion as I had the pleasure of having dinner with the brilliant writer/director Kaloni Davis and the insightful writer/educator David Greenberg. We're thrilled to announce that Another 3-Hearts Productions is set to embark on a powerful journey with our upcoming documentary: "I am Hungry: The Many Faces of Food Insecurity." 

Kaloni Davis's storytelling prowess and David Greenberg's educational insight promise to bring depth and resonance to this project. Together, we aim to shed light on the myriad aspects of food insecurity and ignite conversations that lead to positive change.

As we venture into this impactful production, we invite you to join us on this journey. Stay tuned for behind-the-scenes glimpses, powerful stories, and the collaborative magic that will unfold.

Let's raise awareness, inspire empathy, and work towards a world where no one goes hungry.
