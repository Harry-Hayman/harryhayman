You often see me post about the need for us all to have access to nutrient-rich foods, which is one reason I've joined the Economy Leagues board of directors and taken on the position of Senior Fellow. 
HIt's a big responsibility to be in charge of implementing plans and strategies for the food economy and food policy. But I'm up for the challenge! To me it all starts with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs - having a safe place to live, access to clothing, and nutrient-rich food on their plate. This mission aligns perfectly with that of the Economy League, and I am ready to embrace it wholeheartedly. Food security should not be taken lightly, so here I am â€” focused, determined, and ready for action.

The Economy League of Greater of Philadelphia's board of directors is Made up of more than 60 corporations, institutions, and organizations that care deeply about improving our region; the Economy League's Board of Directors shapes the organization's agenda for the future.
