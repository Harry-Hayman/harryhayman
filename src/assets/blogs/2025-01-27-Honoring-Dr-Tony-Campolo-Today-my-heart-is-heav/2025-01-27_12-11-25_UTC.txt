Honoring Dr. Tony Campolo

Today, my heart is heavy as I reflect on the passing of a friend and neighbor from my youth, Tony Campolo. Growing up just three doors down, Dr. Campolo was more than a neighbor—he was just the sweetest man full of kindness and warmth, who always made time for me. He even, on occasion, took me with him to Eastern College (now University), which is where I played as a boy. I remember going with him as if it was yesterday and him treating me as if I was his own son. There was a beautiful service that was a true celebration of life. 
I’m especially grateful for the meaningful visit we shared not long ago. Sitting with Tony and his wonderful wife, Peggy, was a reminder of the depth of his wisdom and the joy he brought to those around him. My heart goes out to Peggy and Bart during this time. Please know you are in our prayers, and you are surrounded by love.

Tony’s impact reached far beyond his home. He was a man of immense character, vision, and love for humanity, leaving an indelible mark on all who knew him. From his profound teachings to his compassionate leadership, Tony's legacy is one of service and faith.

Dr. Campolo, Tony, you were one of a kind. You will be missed, but your influence will live on in the lives you touched. Rest in peace, my friend.
