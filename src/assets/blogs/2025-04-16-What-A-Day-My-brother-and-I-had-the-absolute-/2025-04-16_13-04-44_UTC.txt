What. A. Day. 

My brother and I had the absolute honor of working alongside the brilliant, badass, and wildly talented chefs (and people) of Double Trellis — a powerhouse of a kitchen and one of Philly’s most inspiring culinary incubators.

To say we were humbled would be an understatement. These folks don’t just cook — they craft. Every dish, every flavor, every detail… executed with passion, purpose, and precision. The energy in that kitchen? Electric. The teamwork? Seamless. The food? Let’s just say Michelin should acknowledge if you ask me.

Massive love and respect to Matt, Adrian, and the ENTIRE crew at Double Trellis — the ones who show up and put in the work day in and day out. What you’ve built is special. What you’re doing is necessary. What you represent is the future.

Deep gratitude to our friends at The Enterprise Center — your support of local foodpreneurs makes this kind of magic possible. And huge shoutout to Sharing Excess and Craversville Farm Foundation for supplying the gorgeous, vibrant, raw ingredients that became the flavorful meals we proudly plated.

Together, we didn’t just cook — we created. And we’re just getting started. 🍽️💥
