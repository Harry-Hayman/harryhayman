When it comes to driving change and building up communities, Eric Marsh is a true force across Philadelphia!  This week, heâ€™s at it again, bringing his energy, vision, and unwavering commitment to WHYY News' Community & Engagement Civic Dialogue Series at the Parkway Central Library. Eric, alongside the amazing team at WHYY, is shining a light on the challenges and opportunities facing small businesses in our city, igniting conversations that matter for everyone who calls Philly home.
