What Do I Miss Most Mondays!

Hanging w/ My Sis! She is the love of my life! My inspiration! Perspiration! Admiration! Adulation!  You name it, she is itâ€¦just fun to be around, funny, irreverent, all those things. Just spending Sunday afternoons w/ her, Ron and the kids is the BEST. Shout out to my Bro Brad too!
