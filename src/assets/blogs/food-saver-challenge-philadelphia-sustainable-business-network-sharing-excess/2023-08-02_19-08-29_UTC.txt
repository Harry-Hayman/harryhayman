The Sustainable Business Network of Greater Philadelphia (SBN), in partnership with the National Defense Resource Council (NRDC launches the Food Saver Challenge’ to Combat Food Waste in Philadelphia 

Friday, August 4, 9:30 at Sharing Excess, 6700 Essington Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19153. ‘Save the Food Challenge’ event announcing more about the program and how area food businesses can get involved!

Across the Philly region, one out of every 10 households doesn’t have access to affordable, healthy food on a consistent basis. How do we respond to food insecurity in Philly? There are government programs that try to address food insecurity through providing money to families to pay for food or supply food distribution systems with nutritious food. Communities also respond through growing their own food in urban farms and gardens, as well as create networks of food pantries and fridges to share free food.
