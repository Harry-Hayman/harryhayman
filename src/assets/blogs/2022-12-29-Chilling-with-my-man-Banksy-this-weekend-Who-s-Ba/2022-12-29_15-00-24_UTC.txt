Chilling with my man Banksy this weekend. Who's Banksy? Clues about the mysterious artist!⁣
Slippery, provocative, mysterious…. Banksy, the British artist whose identity is still unknown, is considered one of the main contemporary street art icons. His art, many times satirical, addresses universal issues such as politics, culture, or ethics. In Philadelphia, an "unauthorized" Banksy’s exhibition, dedicated to the enigmatic artist, lets visitors dive into the controversial artistic universe of the most influential creator of present time.⁣
