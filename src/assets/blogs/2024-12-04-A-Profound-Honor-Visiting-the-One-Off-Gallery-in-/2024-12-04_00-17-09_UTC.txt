A Profound Honor: Visiting the One Off Gallery in Nairobi and Meeting Carol Lees 

This week's posts will be all about my epic trip to Kenya. One of the highlights was stepping into the One Off Contemporary Art Gallery in Nairobi, which was nothing short of a transformative experience. Known as one of Africa’s premier art spaces, the gallery is a treasure trove of creativity, showcasing the rich tapestry of contemporary African art. The curation, atmosphere, and sheer brilliance of the pieces were all masterclasses in storytelling through visual expression. 
But the true highlight of the visit? The distinct privilege of meeting Carol Lees, albeit briefly (didn't want to impose as she was setting up for a show but was able to get a sense of her origin story), the visionary founder behind One Off. A legend in the African art world, Carol has championed countless artists, elevating their voices and placing African art on the global stage. Her passion, dedication, and keen eye for talent have made her a beacon for established and emerging creators across the continent. 

Carol’s impact reaches far beyond the gallery walls. She has nurtured and cultivated a movement that celebrates the vibrancy and diversity of African art, bridging cultures and sparking dialogues worldwide. Meeting her was not just inspiring—it was a reminder of how art can unite us, move us, and challenge us to see the world anew. 

If you’re ever in Nairobi, do yourself a favour and visit the One-Off Gallery. Immerse yourself in the brilliance of African artistry and witness the magic that Carol Lees has worked so tirelessly to create.
