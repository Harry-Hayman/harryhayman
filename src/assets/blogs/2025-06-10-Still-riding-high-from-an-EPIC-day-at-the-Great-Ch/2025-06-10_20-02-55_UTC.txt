Still riding high from an EPIC day at the Great Chefs Event Philly at Urban Outfitters HQ — where world-class bites met world-class hearts! 

Not only did I get to indulge in mind-blowing dishes from some of the best chefs in the country (seriously, still dreaming about it), but I also got to reconnect with some of my high school crew — we make a point of going every year. Big thanks to our friend Jeff for ensuring we go and support.

It’s not every day you get to turn back the clock and pay it forward — all while raising critical funds for Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation to fight childhood cancer. 

Food, friends, and a fantastic cause — my heart (and stomach) are so full. Can’t think of a better way to spend a Saturday.

Already counting down to next year.
