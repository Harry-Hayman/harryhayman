I was bursting with pride and joy as we celebrated one of the brightest lights in my life — my brilliant, beautiful, and unstoppable niece Ella, who just graduated from Georgetown University.
From the moment she arrived on this planet, Ella has been a force — of kindness, intelligence, resilience, and grace. And now, watching her walk across that stage, I’m not just proud… I’m floored. Inspired. In awe.

This isn’t just a diploma.
It’s the result of late nights, big dreams, sharp wit, unwavering integrity, and a heart that always chooses purpose over ease.

She’s not only ready for the world — the world better get ready for her.

- Hoya Saxa.
- Cheers to you, Ella.
- You’ve always been a star — now you’re aiming for galaxies.

Love you endlessly. The best is still ahead....and Happy Birthday!
