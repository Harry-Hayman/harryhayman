Excited to be presenting this event with my company Philly Soul Now, and The Stumble Music group at my friend Mark's place Silk City to benefit a worthy cause Why Not Prosper for Woman's History Month - join us if you can.  https://events.eventnoire.com/e/the-greenlight-series-whme⁣
MARCH 19 @ 8:00 PM – 11:00 PM, Silk City, 435 Spring Garden Street⁣
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  The Greenlight Series featuring Joie Kathos and Andrea Valle at Silk City⁣
Produced by Stumble Media Group, LLC, the objective of the series is to highlight or "Greenlight" some of the best independent talent coming through Philadelphia and the surrounding areas right now while giving audiences an immersive yet intimate experience.  We are trying to give diverse independent talent a platform to showcase what they have to offer by not just providing a venue and an audience but giving them the space to arrange their music with a live band and get paid to do it.⁣
⁣
This month we're donating some proceeds.  Why Not Prosper is a grassroots 501 C (3) organization founded by a formerly incarcerated woman for formerly incarcerated women. We are strong advocates for women, and we are committed to providing programs and services that support women in their re-entry efforts from prison to the community.⁣
Their mission is to help women from prison systems discover their own strength by providing them with the support and resources that will empower them to become responsible, economically self-sufficient, and contributing members of the community.⁣
