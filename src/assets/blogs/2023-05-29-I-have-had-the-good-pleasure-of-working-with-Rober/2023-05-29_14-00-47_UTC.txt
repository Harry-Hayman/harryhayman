I have had the good pleasure of working with Robert on some projects and am aware of all his hard work.⁣
All year long, the Robert Irvine Foundation supports Gold Star Families through our Reuniting the Brave, Resiliency Experience, and Financial Support programs. We bring them together for unique events where they are able to build community, honor their loved ones, and create new memories.⁣
