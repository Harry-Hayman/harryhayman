Please support my friend Jose and all his efforts to feed those in need throughout the world and his new cookbook 
Little known fact, Jose and I opened the first Jaleo together when he first came to the US and what an experience that was! We were introduced by my very dear friend Roberto Alvarez who said "I am going to Spain and I will be back with our chef" and sure enough, he was!
First opening in downtown Washington, DC, in 1993, Jaleo has evolved to represent modern Spain at every moment. Imagined through the creative lens of Chef José Andrés and his team, Jaleo brings alive the spirit and flavors of Spain by showcasing the rich regional diversity of Spanish cuisine. Celebrating the traditional as well as the cutting-edge, Jaleo offers a taste of Spain in a festive, stylish, and casual atmosphere.
José Andrés is a visionary and a humanitarian, establishing World Central Kitchen in 2010 as a means for feeding the many – using culinary training programs to empower communities and strengthen economies as well as food disaster relief in the wake of emergencies around the globe. He has been widely recognized for both his culinary and his humanitarian work.
