A Historic Moment Witnessed! Being present as history was made yesterday was nothing short of exhilarating!

Governor Josh Shapiro's signing of the executive order to diversify supplier spending is a significant step towards a more inclusive and equitable future. @joshshapiropa 

This bold move not only strengthens our commitment to diversity but also recognizes the immense talent and potential within our diverse supplier community; as Josh said, “It is not only the right thing to do, it also makes smart business sense.”

Good to see friends Vincent, Dwight, Anne, and others, and thanks to Della for hosting. @repdwightevans @TECWestPhilly
 Let's celebrate this milestone and continue pushing for positive change. Together, we shape the future!
