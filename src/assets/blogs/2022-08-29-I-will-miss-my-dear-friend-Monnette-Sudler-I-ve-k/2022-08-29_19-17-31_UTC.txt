I will miss my dear friend Monnette Sudler; I’ve known her for over 30 years. I and the world is grateful that Monnette Sudler’s musical legacy lives on through several recorded albums, starting with Brighter Days for You, which was released by the Danish Steeple Chase label in 1977. Last year, that company issued In My Own Way, a recording made in Denmark in 1978, and Ms. Sudler also released Stay Strong, a collection of new songs that reflected on life during the first year of the pandemic.

Monnette Sudler, 68, the Philadelphia jazz guitar virtuoso whose career began in the early 1970s with an avant-garde ensemble Sounds of Liberation and carried on for five decades as a bandleader and backing musician for acts including Grover Washington Jr., David Murray, and Archie Shepp, Monnette Sudler died on Sunday at her home in Germantown. 

If you do not know her music, do yourself a favor and get to know her work. She is not only a Philadelphia treasure, known locally and internationally, but a major contributor in the pantheon of jazz, a real hometown hero Monnette Sudler, will be greatly missed.
