Tonight 10/13/22, at 6 pm, Community College of Philadelphia.  Come out and support my friend Tayyib and his company Little Giant.⁣
 ⁣
The City of Philadelphia is developing a pilot program to broaden how we define art, history, and storytelling in our city.⁣
⁣
Join us to help shape the pilot program and define what culture means in Philly and how it’s preserved to reflect who lives and creates here.⁣
