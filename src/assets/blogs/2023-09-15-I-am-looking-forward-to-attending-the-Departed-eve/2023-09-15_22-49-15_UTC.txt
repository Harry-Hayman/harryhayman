I am looking forward to attending the Departed event this Saturday night. It is going to be an epic night of music, art and culture and I am very much looking forward to seeing it all!

In addition, my new friend Ben Arsenal is taking the stage, and trust me, you don't want to miss his set.
His music is next level and should not be missed. He will also be joined by the EPIC LIFE team, so shout out to them!

Let's make it another unforgettable night. Grab your tickets and invite your friends. We are in for a night of pure vibes, killer beats, and unforgettable memories.
