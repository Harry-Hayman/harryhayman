We often hear that healthy food is more expensive than junk food, which is why we continue to work on ways to improve the situation with our Feed Philly Coalition. Our #1 goal is to do more than we’ve done and provide better opportunities. We’re working with Mustafa Rashed/Bellevue strategists on how to advance the Feed Philly Coalition Mission. Send me a direct message if you have ideas or want to get involved.
