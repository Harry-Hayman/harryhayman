It's Vegan Restaurant Week! 

Whether you're vegan, vegetarian, or simply curious about plant-based dining, this is the perfect time to explore the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. Veganism not only promotes personal health, but it also supports sustainability by reducing our carbon footprint, conserving water, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and potentially could help address food insecurity. 

Either way, this week is a fantastic opportunity to support local eateries that champion delicious, plant-based cuisine and support the Philadelphia Food Economy. I recently visited Fitz on 4th and had an amazing experience! Their menu is creative, flavorful, and packed with plant-based goodness. I highly recommend stopping by to enjoy some of their standout dishes. 
Let’s celebrate Vegan Restaurant Week together and support our local vegan community—every meal makes a difference!
