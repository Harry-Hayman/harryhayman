Very Cool  experience this weekend at "Outstanding In The Field" @FarmerJawn Elkin’s Park Farm @out_inthefield⁣
⁣
Chef George Madosky from the renowned Fork restaurant @forkrestaurant teamed up with the incredible Christa Barfield, aka FarmerJawn, for a culinary adventure that was nothing short of magical.⁣
 George's culinary artistry brought out the best in Christa's locally sourced, farm-fresh ingredients.⁣
It was not just about the food. It was a celebration of diversity, inclusion, community, sustainability, and the vibrancy of local food scene.⁣

Huge thanks to George, Christa, Jim, Meghan, and the entire team from “Outstanding In The Field” behind this unforgettable event. Keep shining your light on our culinary world!  #OutstandingInTheField #FarmToTableMagic #LocalFlavors  #HarryHayman #HarryHaymanPhiladelphia
