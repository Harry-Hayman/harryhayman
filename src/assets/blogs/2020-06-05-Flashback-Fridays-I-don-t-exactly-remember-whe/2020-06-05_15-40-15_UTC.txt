Flashback Fridays – I don’t exactly remember where this was, what I was doing, or how this picture ended up in my kitchen drawer, but I was quite the stud huh? In all seriousness, I have been very fortunate in life to have been able to travel the world as much as I have, and that’s all thanks to my dad. Shout out pops! Throughout my travels, I always checked out the local libations (for pure scientific purposes of course) and as a result of that, I launched my new website, www.pangeacocktails.com — cocktails from around the world! ⠀
