Why am I focusing on my education? My goal is to make the most significant impact in the world of social impact, social entrepreneurship, and social change. Change is something the community needs, and it's my passion.⁣
I will always be working on our Feed Philly Coalition programs and community initiatives, but to study how to be most effective, I'm getting the education to make change happen.⁣
After finishing my Master of Business Administration (MBA), Social Entrepreneurship Major, Magna Cum Laude 2022, Temple University, Fox School of Business | Philadelphia, PA, in the spring, I am looking at PhD programs now.⁣
It's never too late to make change happen!⁣
