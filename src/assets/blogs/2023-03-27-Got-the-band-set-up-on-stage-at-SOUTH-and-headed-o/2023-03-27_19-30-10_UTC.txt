Got the band set up on stage at SOUTH and headed over to Queer Soup Night - Enjoyed a wonderful fruit gazpacho and hearty lentil soup but, more importantly, supported a great cause.⁣
@queersoupnight To cap off our Free Store Pilot.  QSN to raise funds for our pilot. Tasty soups, free store, groceries, please donate to our community fund! 🌈🐰💞⁣
Our mission is to strengthen local queer communities across the country through sharing space, sharing food, and contributing to something bigger than ourselves.⁣
