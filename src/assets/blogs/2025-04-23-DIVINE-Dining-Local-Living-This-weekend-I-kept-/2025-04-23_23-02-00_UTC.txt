DIVINE Dining, Local Living 

This weekend I kept it hyper-local — stayed right on the corridor (for the most part) and was rewarded with a slice of heaven right in the Divine Lorraine.

Sorellina, from the brilliant minds behind Cicala, isn’t just serving pizza — they’re delivering full-on culinary salvation in one of Philly’s most iconic buildings.

Brick oven blistered perfection
Ingredients that sing in Italian
Wine list that says “stay a while”

Philly, North Broad, if you haven’t been… you’re missing a spiritual experience disguised as a neighborhood pizzeria.

And let’s be real:
Why chase hype when excellence lives in your own backyard?

This isn’t fast food — this is slow, soulful, beautifully blistered bliss.
This is what local legends are made of.

So skip the passport and the pretense.

Sorellina’s got your table (or bar stool in my case) waiting — and your taste buds about to testify.
