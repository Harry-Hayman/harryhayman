People often complain about the problems and understand that we face ongoing violence and economic disparity.⁣
⁣
This is why we are working to be part of the solution! We are a part of the Office of Sustainability's first cohort of participants in the first-in-Philly Food Waste Business Challenge.⁣
⁣
The Challenge will directly tackle restaurant food waste in the city. Throughout the Challenge, we will work with the OOS and the Center for EcoTechnology (CET) to implement specific strategies that prevent food from going to waste.⁣
⁣
This Challenge was a unique opportunity for local food businesses to receive FREE food waste reduction guidance collaborating with the City of Philadelphia to work towards achieving zero food waste and help shape sustainability programs and policy down the line.⁣
