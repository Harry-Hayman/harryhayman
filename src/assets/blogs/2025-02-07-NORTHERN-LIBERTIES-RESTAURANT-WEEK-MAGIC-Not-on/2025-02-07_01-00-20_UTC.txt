NORTHERN LIBERTIES RESTAURANT WEEK MAGIC! 

Not one but TWO absolute bangers in NoLibs this week! Bourbon & Branch and North 3rd Restaurant & Bar BOTH delivered knockout experiences—seriously, if you haven’t been to these spots lately (or EVER?!), get it together and GO. 

First up, North 3rd—a spot that somehow manages to be effortlessly cool AND insanely welcoming at the same time. Mark Bee, you absolute legend, you’ve created a place where the food, the drinks, and the vibe just HIT. Every. Single. Time.  Lesson learned: won’t be waiting so long for my next visit!

Then we rolled into Bourbon & Branch, where the cocktails flow like poetry, the food is next-level, and the atmosphere is pure Philly cool. Oh, and did I mention the incomparable @rae.dianz?? Her performance was —soulful, electric, absolutely unforgettable. If you’ve never experienced her live, you’re missing out on something special.

NoLibs Restaurant Week reminded me just how much these two spots define the best of Philly’s food & music scene. Don’t wait. Make a reservation. Go. Live your best life.
