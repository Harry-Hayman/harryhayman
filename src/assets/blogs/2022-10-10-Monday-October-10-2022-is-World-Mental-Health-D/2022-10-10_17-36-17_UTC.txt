Monday, October 10, 2022, is World Mental Health Day. Join me in Celebrating World Mental Health Day. 

Rates of people experiencing mental illnesses, whether personally, in their families, or their community, continue to tell us that mental health and well-being need to be made a priority; however, stigma and discrimination continue to be a barrier to social inclusion and access. As an organization, it's important to support employees and provide resources for managing and addressing these mental health issues.
If you know anyone needing help, Exude provides a mental health tool kit. https://www.exudeinc.com/blog/mental-health-toolkit/
