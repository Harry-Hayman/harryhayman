I had the opportunity to go see Valarie Erwin speak and learn about the culture of the Georgia Sea Islands that have retained its West African roots since the 1700s and its Philadelphia links (Thanks and shout out to Grid Magazine for communicating about this event).⁣
⁣
In addition to a lesson about Geechee cooking, Valerie Erwin explored the culinary connections, both historical and contemporary, between the Low Country–the coast of South Carolina and Georgia–and Philadelphia.⁣
⁣
As an added bonus, the presentation was followed by a sampling of Carolina Gold Rice, Gumbo, collards, and a delightful lentil cucumber salad⁣
⁣
There was also a tour of the historic Wyck House and Gardens after Chef Erwin’s talk.⁣
⁣
It was all made possible by The Historical Foodways of The Delaware Valley⁣
⁣
Valerie Erwin is among such people, a stalwart in Philadelphia for being a fine chef, for her mentorship of young chefs, and as a fierce advocate for the industry with a breathtaking commitment to food justice and security.⁣
⁣
The Gullah Geechee cuisine is a fusion of African cooking techniques and locally available ingredients. Fresh-from-the-ocean shrimp, crab, and fish comprise many of their favorite dishes, while ingredients, including rice, okra, and watermelon, are also staples.⁣
