PLEASE CONTACT CITY COUNCIL TODAY! The future of the Greater Philadelphia Film Industry depends on it! The Greater Philadelphia Film Office is one of the many art organizations in Philadelphia that could lose funding if the budget cut proposal passes. Write to your city council member and urge them to continue funding the local film industry. Let your voice be heard, and together, we can #SavePhillyFilm. #GPFO #PhiladelphiaFilmOffice #gpfophilly #entertainment #philadelphiafilm #greaterphiladelphia #citycouncil www.film.org/savephillyfilm
