Today is National Agriculture Day.

This day, and week, is about recognizing and celebrating the abundance provided by agriculture. 

This is also a time to bring awareness to innovations in agriculture that help get food to everyone who needs it.

Celebrate this day and let's continue the fight against food insecurity!
