Excited to be joining my friend George @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgematysik/ and all the hard-working folks over at SHARE Food Group for this very important event, The Share Food Program's Campaign for Food Justice - Official Launch on Thursday, June 1st Â· 11am - 12:30pm EDT at 2901 West Hunting Park Avenue Philadelphia, PA 19129 to register for the event https://www.eventbrite.com/e/630135069957

George is the Executive Director of the Share Food Program, which is a nonprofit organization serving a regional network of community organizations engaged in food distribution, education, and advocacy.

Share Food Program is launching the most ambitious, transformational fundraising Campaign in our more than 35-year history, with a goal of $35 million in combined donor funding and public support.

The purpose of doing so is to help more of our neighbors in need, advance our anti-hunger programming, make impactful gains against food insecurity, and ensure the health and well-being of our community.

Please join us as we kick off The Campaign for Food Justice, celebrate our mission and committed supporters, and work towards ending hunger for children, seniors, and families throughout our region.

Share serves hundreds of thousands of people facing food insecurity each month.
Share distributes food through our partnerships with 400+ community-based organizations, food sites, and partner pantries across the five-county Philadelphia region.
