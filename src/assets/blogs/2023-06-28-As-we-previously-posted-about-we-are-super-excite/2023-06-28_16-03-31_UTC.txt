As we previously posted about, we are super excited (get it?) to be working with the Super Poor Kids on numerous projects, but one includes merch designs for Philly Soul Now!

The Super Poor Kids art collective has created an art series that merges the happy, whimsical world of Dr. Seuss with the harsh realities of hate, racism, and violence that plague the African American Community on a daily basis.
Philly Soul Now (PSN) is on a mission to make sure that no music lover in the Philadelphia area misses out on great music. This is why we work tirelessly to be at the forefront of breaking news on national tours and music festivals, all the while fervently supporting the artists in our local soul music scene. With an emphasis on Philadelphia’s rich live soul music history, which includes a mix R&B Soul, Jazz, Gospel, and Hip Hop, we are dedicated to keeping our audience up-to-date. https://phillysoulnow.com/

 And you know it wouldn't be a post from me if I didn't get on my soapbox for a minute...come on y'all, we need to support our local artists in all facets...please. Why? Philadelphia’s arts and cultural sector is a vital regional asset that supports thousands of jobs, benefits businesses, and helps grow our economy. When you tally up the spending by arts and cultural organizations and their audiences and how those cultural dollars ripple through our economy, the impact is profound.
