Sometimes you get caught in the moment with your thoughts, or maybe I was intently listening.  One of the things I enjoy doing is connecting with new people and learning new information. I attended the Total Impact Summit 2022 convened 300＋ thought leaders and practitioners from across the United States. The two-day event featured 75＋ speakers across 25＋ sessions, connections, conversations, insights, and best practices at the forefront of a growing impact investing field.⁣

The two-day, dynamic summit connected individual and institutional investors, fund managers, and financial advisors to connect with aligned peers, learn about local and global innovations, discover investable solutions, deploy capital, and generate social impact.
