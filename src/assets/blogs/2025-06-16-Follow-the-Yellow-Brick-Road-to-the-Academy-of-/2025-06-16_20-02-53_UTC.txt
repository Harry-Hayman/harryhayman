Follow the Yellow Brick Road... to the Academy of Music!

Got a taste of pure magic as The Wiz lit up the Academy of Music stage like a technicolor dream! From the first note to the final bow, it was a soul-shaking, joy-spreading, tear-jerking masterpiece that had us all easing on down the road and back again.
This ain't your grandma’s Wizard of Oz — it's funk, it's fashion, it's FEELING. A full-on celebration of Black excellence, power vocals, and bold, unapologetic joy. The choreography? Electric. The costumes? Dazzling. The performances? UNREAL. Dorothy didn’t just find her way home — she brought the house down on the way. 

If you don’t already have your tickets, stop what you're doing and fix that immediately. You owe it to your soul.

Because this isn’t just a show — it’s an experience.
