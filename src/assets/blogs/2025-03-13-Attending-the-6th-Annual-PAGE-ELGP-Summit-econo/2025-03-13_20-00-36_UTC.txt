Attending the 6th Annual PAGE & ELGP Summit @economyleague was an inspiring experience, reinforcing the power of collaboration in fostering equitable economic growth. Engaging with industry leaders like @lauren.rosa.miller from Miller3 Consulting provided invaluable insights into building a diverse and inclusive local economy. Looking forward to implementing these strategies and continuing the journey toward economic equity.
