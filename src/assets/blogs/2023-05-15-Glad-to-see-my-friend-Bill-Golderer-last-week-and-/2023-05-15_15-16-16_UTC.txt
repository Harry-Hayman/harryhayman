Glad to see my friend Bill Golderer last week and support all the hard work he and The United Way are doing.  The Opportunity Summit was a sold-out event with the goal of building a better, stronger future for all.⁣⁣
⁣
Bill serves as President and CEO of United Way of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey (UWGPSNJ) but is best described as our Poverty-Fighting Convener. Bill leads UWGPSNJ's mission to fight poverty and expand opportunity by harnessing the collective power of the corporate, private philanthropy, nonprofit, and public sector.⁣⁣
⁣
Under his leadership, United Way raises and invests over $20 million annually to advance educational attainment, creating career pathways and forging paths to financial empowerment through large-scale initiatives like PHLConnectED, and The Promise, a public-private partnership to help families access opportunities for upward mobility.⁣⁣
At the OpportUNITY Summit, learn how other leaders across sectors are working in partnership to create positive, lasting change.⁣⁣
⁣
The day will include inspirational speakers and spotlight work happening locally and right now in American cities where racial equity, social justice, economic opportunity, and upward mobility can be achieved through transformational public-private collaborations.⁣⁣
