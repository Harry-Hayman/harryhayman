Happy to announce that I’ve mentioned as one of the newest board members of the Economy League. The Economy League of Greater Philadelphia League Board is growing! We officially elected three new directors on October 19th during the Economy League’s Q3 Board of Directors meeting. First to mention is Harry Hayman, the creator of the Feed Philly Coalition, which aims to assist in feeding the less fortunate in Philadelphia. Harry is a trustee to the Gray Bradley Hayman Foundation, a part of the Feed Philly Coalition. He oversees operations at his consulting company, The Gemini Consultants, and serves as Senior Fellow for Food Economy and Policy at the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia.
