Saturday marked the start of an incredible day of #GPLEX, where brilliant minds come together to share knowledge, spark collaborations, and explore regional destinations!
We kicked things off with an impassioned opening address from Kesi Shahaj, whose words set the tone for a day filled with inspiring conversations and transformative ideas. Sharing her personal journal and her vision for a connected, inclusive future ignited the energy in the room as we dove into workshops, panels, and networking sessions!

Stay tuned for updates as we explore new frontiers and build bridges for a better tomorrow.
