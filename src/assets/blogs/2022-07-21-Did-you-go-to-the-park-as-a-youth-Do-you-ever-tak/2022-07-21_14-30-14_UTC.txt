Did you go to the park as a youth? Do you ever take a walk in the park? I know I do, which is one of the reasons I get involved with the "Love Your Park" project.⁣
⁣
Love Your Park is your portal to getting involved in Philly's parks. From regular volunteer workdays to citywide celebrations and year-round community organizing, Love Your Park brings Philadelphians together to clean, green, and celebrate our public green spaces. We love small neighborhood parks and large watershed natural areas, and we are here for Philly's parks. Throughout the summer, there will be pop-up Love Your Park events. If you want to get involved, the next scheduled event is Cobbs Creek Park, Woodland Ave., and Cobbs Creek Parkway.⁣
July 24th, 2:00pm – 4:00pm. Join the Cobbs Creek Cleanup team to clean a historic section of Cobbs Creek! https://loveyourpark.org/events
