Thrilled to Be Part of Something Bigger 

I’m beyond honored to collaborate with Dr. Jonathan Deutsch, Evan Ehlers, and the incredible team at the Drexel Food Lab working on this groundbreaking project to localize the food economy. This initiative is about so much more than just food rescue—it’s a bold vision of identifying problems and creating actionable solutions that benefit both our communities and our planet.

Evan’s organization, Sharing Excess, exemplifies the power of innovative thinking. Not only are they feeding people directly with rescued food, but by focusing on localizing the food economy, they’re addressing the systemic barriers that perpetuate food insecurity. When we keep resources local, we strengthen our communities, reduce waste, and create resilient systems that benefit everyone—whether it’s through providing jobs, reducing environmental impact, or ensuring equitable access to fresh, healthy food.

This work is more than theory—it’s thinking and doing, and I couldn’t be prouder to play a part in it. Together, we’re taking steps toward a sustainable future, where no food goes to waste, and everyone has access to the nourishment they need.

A localized food economy doesn’t just feed people today—it builds the foundation to feed communities tomorrow.

Thank you, Jonathan and Evan, for leading the charge and inspiring us all. Let’s keep pushing boundaries and making real change happen.
