Connecting and networking with like-minded people is essential when working in the social impact community. One networking event I will attend is the Network After Work, an evening out with other local business owners, entrepreneurs, executives, and career-minded professionals.⁣

Join me on Tuesday, August 23rd, at 6 pm at The Plough & The Stars | 123 Chestnut Street Entrance on 2nd St. Philadelphia, PA 19106⁣

Experience networking like never before! Network After Work, a leader in networking events, has changed the art of networking. With access to numerous in-person networking events, virtual networking events, and live workshops each month, connecting with the people you need became that much easier.⁣
