Sundays are for sinners... and Cézanne.

Today’s vibe? High art, a hint of rebellion, and a whole lot of Cecily Brown.
Hit up the Barnes Foundation to catch “Cecily Brown: Themes and Variations”—and let me tell you, this ain’t your grandmother’s Impressionism.

Brown’s work is raw, explosive, sensual. Imagine if Willem de Kooning and Joan Mitchell had a love child who painted with a fever dream of flesh, myth, and memory. That’s Cecily.
Her brushwork bleeds movement, with nods to the masters... and a wink to the bedroom.

Honestly? A little risqué for the Barnes—and that’s saying something.

Big love to the curators for pushing the envelope and reminding us that art should challenge, stir, and make you squirm a little.
If you haven’t been, go. Stand too close. Lose yourself. Be shaken.

Then go have a martini and pretend you're not googling “Cecily Brown prints.”
