The Gray Bradley Hayman award is near and dear to my heart as my father, my sister and I continue to offer the Gray Bradley Hayman award In honor of my brother Gray Bradley Hayman. The Baseball Award is awarded to students who persevered and made it back to the baseball field after injury or adversity and overcame obstacles. 

It’s all about learning valuable lessons and showing effort to get back up and on the baseball field. 
When life gives you a bad blow, what do you do when you get back up? 
Let’s figure it out and persevere.
