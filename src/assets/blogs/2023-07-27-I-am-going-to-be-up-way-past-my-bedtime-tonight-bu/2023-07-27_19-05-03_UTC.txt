I am going to be up way past my bedtime tonight but for good reason...tonight's inaugural @theboombox215 The Boom Box 215! Don't know, now you know...here we are planning tonight's festivities...we have the most powerful thing in the world ...happiness...we have it in the palm of our hands, and our plan tonight is to share it! "Be there or Be Square" (who remembers the reference..."Happy Days"!??...wrong reference, Kev?)...special shout out and thanks in advance to Bacardi and Silk for making this all possible!

 @theboombox215 SOUL TO ROCK N’ ROLL — JULY 27TH @ SILK CITY The first installment of “The Boombox” comes to Silk City on Thursday, July 27th @ 9 pm. The City Root

With featured acts & talented-driven selective jams, The Boombox weaves the timeless influence of rock n’ roll with hip-hop, funk, and R&B.

The first show will feature R&B heartbreaker Sunnie and standout genre jumper Boogieman Dela. A hand-picked band of some musical all-stars will steer the evening, and DJ NDot on the tables to keep feet moving. @iiamsunnie @mixedbagphilly N Dot The Brand
The Boombox is curated by Nate Zavetis (formerly of the Funkitorium and other awesome live acts), presented by The City Root and S & G Events, and sponsored by Bacardi.
