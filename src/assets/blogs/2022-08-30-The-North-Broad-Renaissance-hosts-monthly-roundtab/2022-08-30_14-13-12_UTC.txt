The North Broad Renaissance hosts monthly roundtables, and we are so honored to be hosting the NBR Business Roundtable Meeting at SouthSide on August 31st. 

The ultimate goal for the North Broad Street corridor is community revitalization. The North Broad Renaissance is a non-profit that serves as a Special Service District (SSD) whose primary role is to provide communication and information to City administrators and Council, neighborhood and community groups, and others who are (or may) do business or development or other activities on North Broad, from City Hall to Germantown Avenue. In partnership with community stakeholders, we are revitalizing the community, creating opportunities, and improving the economic power and overall quality of life along North Broad. NorthBroad.org
