Zanzibar Blue was the epicenter of Philadelphia’s jazz scene, first at 305 S. 11th St. from 1990 to 1996 and next at the Bellevue at Broad and Walnut Streets from 1996 to 2007.Courtesy of the Bynum brothers. Thank you to Michael Klein from The Philadelphia Inquirer for capturing the story of the history of Zanzibar Blue. Most people may not know I started as a bartender in 1992; after doing almost every job in the Bynum organization, and am now a special-events coordinator.⁣
