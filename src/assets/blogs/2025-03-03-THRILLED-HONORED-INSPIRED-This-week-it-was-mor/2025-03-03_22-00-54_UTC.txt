THRILLED. HONORED. INSPIRED.

This week it was more than a meal—it was an experience, a celebration, and a moment of true hospitality! 💫 I am beyond grateful, honored, and thrilled to have been part of the Kitchen Take-Over Series with SOUTH Restaurant & Jazz Club and the incredible Broad Street Love! 
At SOUTH, we believe that everyone deserves a seat at the table, no exceptions. So, we took it to the next level with what we affectionately call "Nightclub @ Noon"—where the less fortunate were treated to the exact same experience as our Saturday night guests. 

💃🏾 A live band bringing the jazz, rhythm & soul
🎤 An MC, hosts, and our passionate team
🍽️ SOUTH’s signature cuisine, served with love
❤️ A warm, welcoming atmosphere where dignity and joy were on the menu

This was more than just feeding people—it was about creating an unforgettable experience, where every guest felt seen, valued, and celebrated.

🙏 Huge shoutout to Broad Street Love for the work they do day in and day out. If you’re looking for an organization to support that is making a REAL impact in Philadelphia, THIS. IS. IT.

💡 Let’s keep the love going! Follow, support, donate, and be part of the movement!
