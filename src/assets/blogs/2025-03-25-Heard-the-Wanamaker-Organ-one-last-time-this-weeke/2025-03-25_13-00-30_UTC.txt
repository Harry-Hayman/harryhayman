Heard the Wanamaker Organ one last time this weekend.
Standing in that grand old space—Wanamaker’s, Macy’s—memories came rushing back.
My parents bringing me there as a kid, the lights, the wonder.

People said it felt sad.
But for me? It felt like a turning page.

Not an ending. A beginning.
Philly’s not done telling stories. And neither is that building.
