Celebrating Juneteenth: Freedom Day

Today, we commemorate Juneteenth, a pivotal moment in American history. On June 19, 1865, enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, were finally informed of their freedom, marking the end of slavery in the United States. 

This day represents the long journey toward freedom, justice, and equality for all.

Juneteenth is not just a celebration of freedom, but also a time to reflect on our past, recognize the progress weâ€™ve made, and continue striving for a future where equality and justice prevail.
Let us honor the resilience, strength, and contributions of African Americans throughout history and acknowledge the work that still needs to be done to achieve true equality.

Join us in celebrating this significant day by supporting Black-owned businesses, educating ourselves and others, and committing to actions that promote justice and equality in our communities.
Happy Juneteenth!
