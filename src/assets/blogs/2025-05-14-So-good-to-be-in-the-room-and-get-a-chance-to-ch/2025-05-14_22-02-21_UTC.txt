So good to be in the room.

and get a chance to chat with Jerry Sweeney, Carl Dranoff, and so many of the city’s powerhouses working to shape the future of Philadelphia—this morning was more than a panel. It was a manifesto for progress.
From bold visions to grounded realities, the conversations sparked at this Center City Business Association event reminded me: The best way to predict the future is to write it. And if you were in that room, you know—we’re picking up the pen.

Grateful to connect with old friends and new allies. This kind of convening is exactly what we need: smart minds, tough questions, shared purpose. The future of Center City won’t just happen—it’ll be built by those with the courage and clarity to see beyond what is, and fight for what could be.

Big thanks to Ben and the entire team at Center City City Business Association for putting on this and other essential convenings.
Let’s keep showing up, speaking up, and building up.
