Special acknowledgment and thanks to my friend, Max Ochester, for inviting me into the studio to get a true behind-the-scenes view of him doing his thing.  Not only is he keeping independent music stores alive, he is keeping lost artists and genres alive with his label.  Well done, my friend.⁣⁣

#MaxOchester, the owner of Brewerytown Beats, had collected records in his basement for years before deciding to share his passion for music with his neighborhood. Today, he runs the colorful, welcoming record store where he commits to his mission:⁣⁣
“To preserve and celebrate Philadelphia music, particularly decades-old, forgotten treasures at risk of being lost to history.”⁣⁣

What else was really cool was we were in the studio of Hooter Rob Hyman, and I got to see the gold record for “Time After Time,”…all time classic song.⁣⁣
⁣
“Time After Time” classic Cyndi Lauper hit created right here in Philly.  Cyndi Lauper enlisted Philly band the Hooters to back her up and ended up finding songwriting chemistry with Rob Hyman. Together, they would make chart history with the single “Time After Time.”⁣⁣
Lauper and Hyman channeled their personal heartbreaks into one of the songs that would turn Lauper into a pop phenomenon.⁣⁣
