You know when you are not sure what to expect from something, and it turns out to be completely awesome (maybe b/c you didn't have any preconceived notions?). Well, that was what Saturday was like at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens...such a cool place!

 I encourage you all to check it out if/when you have time.

The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, located in the heart of Brooklyn, New York, is an urban botanical garden that connects people to the world of plants. Here are a few brief details about it:

1. **Established:** The garden was founded in 1910 and is a beloved part of New York City, spanning 52 acres. 

2. **Collections:** It features more than 18,000 kinds of plants and over a dozen specialty gardens, including a Japanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, a Native Flora Garden, a Fragrance Garden, a Water Garden, and more.

3. **Education:** The garden is an active center for education and research, offering programs in conservation, horticulture, and urban greening.

I also got a chance to see/kibitz briefly with the man responsible for Bloomberg's Million Trees initiative...so cool!

MillionTreesNYC is a public-private campaign to plant and care for one million trees over a decade and an important component of Mayor Bloombergâ€™s PlaNYC initiative to make New York City more sustainable.
