Highlight of the Week!

This week was nothing short of inspiring as I was blessed with the incredible opportunity to sit down with Representative Dwight Evans @repdwightevans and District Director Felicia Parker-Cox. We delved into some meaningful discussions about important work we're gearing up for in 2024.

Representative Evans's dedication to public service is truly commendable. His tireless efforts and unwavering commitment to our community have made a lasting impact. Having the chance to potentially collaborate on upcoming projects is an honor, and I'm eager to contribute to the positive changes we're striving for.

As a bonus, I received an autographed copy of Representative Evans's book, "Making Ideas Matter." This resonates deeply with me, as it mirrors the essence of what we aim to accomplish together. Ideas have the power to shape the future, and I'm thrilled to be part of a movement that seeks to make meaningful ideas come to life.

Grateful for the opportunity to learn from and work alongside such dedicated individuals. 

Here's to making ideas matter and creating positive change!
