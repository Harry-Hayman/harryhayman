Riverwards Produce: A Local Gem in Fishtown! 

Stopped by Riverwards Produce in Fishtown today while waiting to meet a friend and WOW—I had forgotten just how cool this little spot is! This place isn’t just a grocery store; it’s a love letter to our local food economy.

From farm-fresh produce to carefully curated specialty items, Riverwards is a reminder of how important it is to support local grocers, farmers, and food artisans. Every dollar spent here keeps our food system diverse, sustainable, and community-driven.

In a world dominated by big-box stores and mass production, places like this are a lifeline for local agriculture and independent businesses. So next time you're in Fishtown, skip the chain stores and support a true local food champion!
