Yup, another post about New York…this time about the dining scene.  I been wanting to make it to 11 Madison Park for months (I had been before but without the context) after I got a chance to see and meet Will Guidara as well as read his book, Unreasonable Hospitality (my friend Bill also worked w/ them as well – small world!) and they went vegan!⁣
