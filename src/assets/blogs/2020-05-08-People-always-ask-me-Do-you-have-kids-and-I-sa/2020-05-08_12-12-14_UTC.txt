People always ask me, “Do you have kids?” and I say ”…No, I have restaurants. They are a lot like restaurants.” And then they say “Don’t you miss having kids?” and I say “HELL NO”…joking…I say “FUCK NO!” Seriously, I say I have the most awesome nieces and nephews that I love spending time with, and then the best part…I get to leave and Ron pays for their education! #justplaying #loveyouguys #niecesandnephews #seriously #ihavetroubletakingcareofmyself #jacksonbraunfeld #reed #ellabraunfeld #donner #blitzen #rudolph #restaurants #kids #family #flashbackfriday
