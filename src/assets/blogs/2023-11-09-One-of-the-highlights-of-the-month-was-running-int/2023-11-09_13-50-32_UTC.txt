One of the highlights of the month was running into @charliemackfirstout and @shellyshellwilliams at the premiere of "King Fish 2".

I have known Charlie since The Brave New World Days – remember that one kids?

Charlie and I then ended up connecting on deep conversations about life, liberty, and the incredibly challenging journey of filmmaking.  He schooled me what he has been up to, the making of Ali, projects out there about TSOP, Teddy and others and I told him about my “Metronome, Everyone is Trying To Find Their Rhythm in Life” Screenplay and my concept for “The Cadillac Club, Rhythms of Resilience” story. @metronomethemovie @metronomethefilm @harryhayman3heartsexperience 

I appreciate his time and schooling me, a little bit.  It is always a privilege to spend time with friends who inspire and uplift your spirits, especially ones that go back many decades and have seen and done all that Charlie has.

Here's to meaningful discussions, inspiring films, and cherished friendships!
