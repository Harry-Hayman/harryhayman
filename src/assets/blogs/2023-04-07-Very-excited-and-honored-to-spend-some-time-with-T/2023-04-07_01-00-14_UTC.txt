Very excited and honored to spend some time with Tony Payton over the last couple of weeks.  First, I saw him at the Sixers Event at SouthSide, and then we met again to talk about all the exciting things he is up to and all the great things he has in store for Philadelphia…we are excited to be working with him.⁣
Tony has spent most of his career in government. Tony Payton is a Lobbyist at David Scott Partners based in Ambler, Pennsylvania. Mr. Payton enjoys devoting his free time to serving the nonprofit community as a board member of City Year Greater Philadelphia, The Fairmount Park Conservancy, Mastery Charter Schools, and the Philadelphia Youth Poetry Movement.  He also is a Big with Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Southeastern Pennsylvania.⁣
