So happy, proud, and honored to have welcomed my new friend Jose James to SOUTH this weekend - could not have been a cooler dude not to mention put on a stellar show!⁣
⁣
A jazz artist for the hip-hop generation, José James artfully blurs the lines between traditional and contemporary jazz, hip-hop, soul, funk, pop, and rock. He has released 11 critically-acclaimed albums.⁣
