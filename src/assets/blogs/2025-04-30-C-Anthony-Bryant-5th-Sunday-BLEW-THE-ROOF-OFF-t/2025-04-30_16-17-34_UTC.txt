C. Anthony Bryant & 5th Sunday BLEW THE ROOF OFF this weekend! 

If you were lucky enough to be at SOUTH RESTAURANT & JAZZ CLUB this weekend, you know exactly what I’m talking about. C. Anthony Bryant didn’t just perform — he transformed the stage into a sanctuary of soul, spirit, and sheer brilliance. His voice? A force of nature. His presence? Magnetic. His artistry? Unmatched.  His storytelling?  It was like you were there.​
And let’s talk about 5th Sunday — the band was absolutely on fire! Their synergy, groove, and passion elevated the entire experience to celestial heights. Together, they created a night of music that was nothing short of transcendent.​

This wasn’t just a concert; it was a musical revival. A heartfelt thank you to C. Anthony Bryant and 5th Sunday for reminding us of the transformative power of live music!​
