An Evening of Artistry and Music with Steve Turre and Andromeda.

What an absolute delight it was to host the incredible Steve Turre, the maestro of the trombone and a true shell artist, at SOUTH! 

Steve's mesmerizing performance was a testament to his unparalleled talent, while his daughter Andromeda added her own unique magic to the evening. 
Their shared passion for music and art filled the room with inspiration and creativity. It's moments like these that make SOUTH a special place where artistry and soul come together. 

Thank you, Steve Turre and Andromeda, for gracing us with your presence and talent. We look forward to more unforgettable performances and artistic journeys!
