My condolences to the family and friends of Michael Hinson Jr. We’ve crossed paths a few times, and he was a good dude.⁣
⁣
Hinson, a longtime AIDS, housing activist, and leader in Philadelphia’s Black LGBTQ community, died Saturday of an undisclosed cause, according to longtime friends and statements by various organizations in which he was involved.⁣
⁣
Those who worked with him describe Hinson as a force for good, an educator, and a friend whose unwavering belief that things could change for the better was matched by his ability to care for the people around him.⁣
