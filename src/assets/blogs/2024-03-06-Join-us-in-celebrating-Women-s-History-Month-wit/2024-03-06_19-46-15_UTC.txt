🌟 Join us in celebrating Women's History Month with the GPLEX community! 🎉

Mark your calendars for March 15th at Ross Commons as we honor the incredible contributions of women throughout history.

Did you know Philadelphia played a pivotal role in abolitionist efforts? Women like Caroline Still Anderson led the charge, advocating for civil rights and educational equality. Anderson, a trailblazing educator and activist, established the Women's Medical Center, providing vital healthcare to underserved communities.

Ready to celebrate remarkable trailblazers like Anderson? Join us at GPLEX360: Tipsy Women's History! Let's raise a glass to their legacies and empower future generations.
