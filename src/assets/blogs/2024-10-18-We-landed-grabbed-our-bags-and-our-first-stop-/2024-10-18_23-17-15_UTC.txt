We landed, grabbed our bags, and our first stop? 🌮 
You guessed it—The Waves Taco Club in San Diego! The perfect intro to the city with delicious tacos and burritos, a cool vibe, and top-notch service.
The soy chorizo & mushroom tacos were an absolute standout—flavor-packed and a must-try! 🌱🔥

Excited to explore more of San Diego’s local eats, support the community, and make the most of every culinary experience while doing it sustainably and equitably! 🌍💸 #SupportLocal #TacoTime #SanDiegoEats #FoodieAdventures #EatLocal
