A few pieces of art that caught my eye from the Nahmad Contemporary presented a view of Jean-Michel Basquiat: Art and Objecthood. Curated by Basquiat scholar Dr. Dieter Buchhart, the exhibition is the first dedicated to the role of found objects and unconventional materials in the artist’s oeuvre. Basquiat, whose artistic practice has profoundly impacted audiences on an international scale, used objects and media from his environs to proliferate messages of social justice and change.⁣

Bringing together a breadth of unconventional painted supports and found-object sculptures, Jean-Michel Basquiat: Art and Objecthood provides an innovative, in-depth look into the artist’s sculptural practice. In addition to painting and drawing on everything within his domestic spaces—refrigerators, chairs, cabinets—Basquiat harnessed and left his mark on items he encountered on the street—discarded windows and doors, mirrors, wood boards, subway tiles. Notably, such found objects were among the artist’s earliest creations.
