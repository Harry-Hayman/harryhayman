Epic night at The Franklin Institute Friday night for the premiere of "A Hope That Lights The Way" written and directed by friend and collaborator Kaloni Davis...such an important project. As an added note, it was good to see and chat briefly with my friend Mayor Jim (Kenney) @phillymayor whom I've known for so many years I can't remember (Zanzibar Blue on Broad, maybe 11TH Street) anyway...my point is the dignitaries were in the house for this most, well deserved, prestigious event. Job well down to Eric Westbrook and his team at the Mayorâ€™s Office of Black Male Engagement. kaloni_davis @obmephl

A Hope That Lights The Way is both a community-based engagement process and a documentary project that unveils and uplifts the impactful stories of individuals who have successfully overcome the daunting challenges posed by gun violence.

The Franklin Institute is a science museum and the center of science education and research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Franklin Institute Science Museum is located in Center City Philadelphia, at the intersection of 20th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.
