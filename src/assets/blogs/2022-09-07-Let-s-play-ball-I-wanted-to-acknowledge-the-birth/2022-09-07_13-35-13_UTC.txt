Let’s play ball! I wanted to acknowledge the birthday of one of my heroes, Frank Robinson, an American baseball player, and manager. Frank Robinson (born August 31, 1935, Beaumont, Texas, U.S—died February 7, 2019, Los Angeles, California) was an American professional baseball player who became the first Black manager in Major League Baseball. Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982.⁣
