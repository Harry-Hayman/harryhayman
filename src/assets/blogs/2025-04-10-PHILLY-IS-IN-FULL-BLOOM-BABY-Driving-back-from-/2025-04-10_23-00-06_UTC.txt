PHILLY IS IN FULL BLOOM, BABY 

Driving back from mom's this weekend, I took a detour through Fairmount Park this weekend and damn near drove into a haiku.
Cherry. Blossoms. Everywhere.
Cotton-candy trees exploding in pink perfection like the city whispered, “Yeah, I still got it.”

If you’ve never seen Philadelphia wrapped in petals, now’s your moment.
This isn't just nature doing her thing—it's a love letter to our city. A reminder that even in the chaos, beauty shows up, unapologetically, in full bloom.

The Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival happened this weekend (April 5-6) at the Horticulture Center.
Vendors, performances, food, culture, joy—it’s the real Philly spring vibe.
Bring your camera. Bring your crew. Bring your damn soul.

Trust me—this should be on the list so if you missed it this year, mark your calendars for next year.
