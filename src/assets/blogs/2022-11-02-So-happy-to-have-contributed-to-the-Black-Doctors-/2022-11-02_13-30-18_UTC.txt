So happy to have contributed to the Black Doctors Consortium and honored by their invite to "An Evening of Celebration & Giving" on the one-year anniversary of the opening of the center.⁣
Under the visionary leadership of Founder Dr. Ala Stanford and CEO Kamau Stanford, the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium (BDCC) has shifted the paradigm of the delivery of medical services.⁣
