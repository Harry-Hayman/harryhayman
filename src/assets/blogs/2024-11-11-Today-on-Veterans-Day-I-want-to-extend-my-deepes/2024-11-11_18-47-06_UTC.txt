Today, on Veterans Day, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to all who have served in our armed forces. Your courage, sacrifice, and dedication have laid the foundation for the freedoms we hold dear.

This day holds special significance for me as I honor my family members who answered the call to serveâ€”my grandfather, Harry G. Hayman II, and my uncles, Greg and Will. Your legacy of strength and commitment reminds me daily of the incredible contributions our veterans have made and continue to make for our country.

Thank you to all veterans for your service, your resilience, and your unwavering dedication. We are forever indebted to you, and I am proud to celebrate and remember you today.
