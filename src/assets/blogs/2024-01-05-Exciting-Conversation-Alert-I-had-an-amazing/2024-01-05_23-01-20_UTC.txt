ðŸŒŸ Exciting Conversation Alert! ðŸŒŸ

I had an amazing time chatting with the dynamic Dawn Frisby Byers, true friend and a seasoned marketing executive with a rich background in brand development, strategic partnerships, and the ins and outs of both traditional and digital marketing. 
Dawn's journey spans from the cable television industry with HBO and Bravo to her impactful role as Vice President of Marketing and Communications at the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem. 

Her expertise has left an indelible mark on the arts and cultural scene, not just in NYC, but also right here in Philly. 

It was an absolute pleasure to have Dawn share her insights, experiences, and passion during our conversation. 

Stay tuned for more highlights and gems from our discussion as we are discussing many exciting things including "I am Hungry in Philadelphia" and "Sunday Suppa" - one city, one meal!
