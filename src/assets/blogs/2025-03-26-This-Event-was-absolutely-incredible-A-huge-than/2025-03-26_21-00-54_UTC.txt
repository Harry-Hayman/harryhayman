This Event was absolutely incredible 🌟
A huge thank you to Entrust Financial for hosting and inviting us to such a beautiful celebration at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to mark 10 Years Independent! 👏✨

From the stunning backdrop of the Christina Ramberg exhibit, to the elegant French brasserie dinner, heartfelt Fireside Chat, and vibrant jazz by the talented Shakinah B, the night was a flawless blend of art, empowerment, and inspiration. 🎨🎶💫

Special shoutouts to the amazing McKenzie and Jennifer for their energy and grace — and of course to the visionary Joslyn Ewart for leading with purpose and style. 💼👑

Women supporting women, building legacies, and celebrating each other — this is what it’s all about. 💪💃

🎉 Here's to more nights like this. Cheers to 10 years and the journey ahead! 🥂
