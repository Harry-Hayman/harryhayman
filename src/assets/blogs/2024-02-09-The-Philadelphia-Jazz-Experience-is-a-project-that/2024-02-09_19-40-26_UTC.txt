The Philadelphia Jazz Experience is a project that is alive and doing well!

Our goal is to bring Jazz Festivals to Philadelphia, which currently lacks the celebration of this Jazz. 

We want our events to attract audiences on a national level, similar to festivals in other cities in the US.

We are hoping to launch in time for Philadelphiaâ€™s 250th anniversary, in 2026.
