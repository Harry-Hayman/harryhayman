So great to meet, connect, have dinner with Victoria Butler and learn about Uncle Nearest...a truly wonderful story, and we are so happy and proud to feature it at SOUTH. 
Uncle Nearest CEO Fawn Weaver and master blender Victoria Eady Butler are carving out an ever-growing space for Black female voices in the whiskey world.
In the 1850s, an enslaved man, Nathan "Nearest" Green, was the one who taught a young Jack Daniel how to distill Tennessee whiskey. Once the Civil War was over, Daniel then hired Green, now a free man, to be his first head distiller. 

 Victoria Eady Butler, Green's great-great-granddaughter, is Uncle Nearest's master blender and the first known Black woman master whiskey blender in history.
