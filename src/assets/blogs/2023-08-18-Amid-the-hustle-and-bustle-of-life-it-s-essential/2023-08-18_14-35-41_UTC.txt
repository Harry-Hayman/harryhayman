Amid the hustle and bustle of life, it's essential to pause and truly appreciate the kindness that blossoms around us. Today, we're taking a moment to pause, appreciate and extend our heartfelt gratitude to The Patricia Kind Family Fund and Patty, Chrissy, Zac and the whole family for all they do. They don’t do it for acknowlegments like this, I know that, but it is still important to say “Thank you”. Their generous support towards our feasibility study has illuminated our path and made our journey even more meaningful. Here is to the beauty of collaboration and the promise it holds. Thank you so much for believing in our vision – it will not be forgotten. #GratitudeGrows #CommunitySupport #MakingDreamsBloom"

The mission of the Patricia Kind Family Foundation is to financially support organizations that help those struggling daily with the effects of poverty.

In positive psychology research, gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness. Gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships.
