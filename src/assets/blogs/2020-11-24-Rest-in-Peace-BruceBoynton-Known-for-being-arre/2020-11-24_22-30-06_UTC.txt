Rest in Peace #BruceBoynton . Known for being arrested when he refused to leave whites only section of a bus station restaurant.  He and his lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, went to the Supreme Court, and eventually got a decision that overturned the segregation on barring segregation on buses. This inspired the #freedom #riders, who would ride on buses throughout the south to make sure there was no segregation. #Bruce #Boynton was known for his work in civil rights throughout his life, in his hometown #selma #alabama, where he was a civil rights attorney, and in the history books, where he is known for his stand and his influence. 

Rest in peace to this iconic man.
