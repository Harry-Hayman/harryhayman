Happy to support our friends at the Clef Club and especially our friend Lovett. I love the work that The Clef Club does. The Philadelphia Clef Club of Jazz and Performing Arts (PCC) mission is to “celebrate and preserve the legacy of jazz through accessible education for the Greater Philadelphia region, and to support the evolving art form through talent development, programming, and public performance.” The Philadelphia Clef Club operates in four distinct lines of business: music education, performance events, a membership program, and facility rentals.⁣
