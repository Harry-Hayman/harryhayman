What an incredible day at the "Ideas We Should Steal" Festival at the Comcast Technology Centre! ðŸŒŸ

The energy in the room was palpable, and many sessions set the tone for a day of inspiration and impactful discussions. But the highlight,  in my opinion? "When Public Meets Private"â€”a powerful conversation that showcased the immense potential of collaboration that we so sorely need in Philadelphia.

ðŸ•° 11:15-11:40 AM | When Public Meets Private
Kathryn Wylde, CEO of The Partnership for New York City, joined Michael Forman, Chairman and CEO of FS Investments, for an eye-opening dialogue on how business leaders can partner with the government to truly serve the common good. Moderated by the remarkable Dalila Wilson-Scott, Comcastâ€™s EVP and Chief Diversity Officer, this session was a masterclass in leadership, innovation, and actionable change.

Key Takeaways:

1. The critical role of private-public partnerships in driving equity and sustainability.
Insightful strategies for businesses to create systemic impact.
2. Real-life examples of how leaders are stepping up to address society's biggest challenges.
And as if that wasnâ€™t enoughâ€”what a thrill to see Larry Platt leading the charge and to have a conversation with Michael Forman about working with the Equity Alliance to tackle food insecurity! Iâ€™m beyond excited about the possibilities ahead and the chance to make a real difference.

This event is proof that when leaders, thinkers, and changemakers come together, anything is possible (and necessary). A Big Thank you to everyone who made this event possible.
