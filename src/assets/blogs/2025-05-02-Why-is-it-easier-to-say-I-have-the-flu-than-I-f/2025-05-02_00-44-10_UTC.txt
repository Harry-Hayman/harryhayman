Why is it easier to say “I have the flu” than “I feel depressed”? 💭

Because for far too long, mental health has been misunderstood, silenced, and pushed aside.
We live in a world where people are afraid to open up, where pain is hidden behind smiles, and where asking for help is seen as weakness instead of strength.

The truth is:
🧠 Mental health is just as real—and just as important—as physical health.
But the fear of judgment keeps too many people suffering in silence.

This World Mental Health Month, let’s change that.
Let’s create space for honesty, for vulnerability, and for healing.
Let’s remind ourselves and each other: “It’s okay to not be okay.”

💚 You are not alone.
💚 You are not broken.
💚 You are worthy of help and hope.

This World Mental Health Month, let’s break the silence.
Let’s make space for vulnerability, honesty, and healing.
💚 Let’s remind each other: You are not alone. You are not broken. You are worthy of care.
