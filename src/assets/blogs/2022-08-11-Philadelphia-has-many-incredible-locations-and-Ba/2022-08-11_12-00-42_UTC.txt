Philadelphia has many incredible locations, and Bartram's Garden is so cool! I found another of my happy places for so many reasons. It's many things to many people: a home for horticulture, an ancient riverfront, an African Diaspora farm, and a place of untold histories.⁣

Bartram's Garden is a 50-acre public garden and National Historic Landmark in Southwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, situated on Lenape territory on the banks of the Tidal Schuylkill River. If you are a Philadelphian and have not had a chance to visit, it's a must on your Philadelphia Bucket List and for the out-of-towners, check it out https://www.bartramsgarden.org/⁣
