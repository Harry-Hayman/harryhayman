WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, HONEYSUCKLE! 

There are restaurant openings… and then there are revolutions in the form of restaurants. What Omar Tate and Cybille St.Aude-Tate have built with Honeysuckle Provisions is not just ambitious — it’s a culinary, cultural, and community-powered landmark in the making.

Black excellence. Intellectual nourishment. Deep-rooted food justice. And food that SLAPS on every level.

We are beyond proud to have this powerhouse project join our corner of the city. The artistry, intentionality, and soul behind Honeysuckle is something Philly — and the world — needs more of. This is more than a restaurant. It’s a movement with fermentation tanks and flavor bombs.

To Omar, Cybille, and the whole Honeysuckle team: We see you. We salute you. We’re rooting for your success and standing with you 100%. Let’s build together.

Opening April 24 GO. EAT. SUPPORT. SPREAD THE WORD.
