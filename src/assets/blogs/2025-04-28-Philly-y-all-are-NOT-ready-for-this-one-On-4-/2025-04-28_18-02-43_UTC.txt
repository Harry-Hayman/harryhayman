🔥 Philly, y’all are NOT ready for this one.

On 4.29, "MANIFESTO" drops live at Silk City—and trust me, it’s more than music. It’s movement. It’s purpose. It’s power.

Major props to @majorkey and the incredible lineup bringing the heat. Come feel it live, feel it loud. You’ll leave different. 👏🏽💥

🎤 Doors @ 7 | Show @ 8
📍 Silk City
🎶 Vibez. Verses. Vision.

Pull up. Make some noise. Let’s move.
