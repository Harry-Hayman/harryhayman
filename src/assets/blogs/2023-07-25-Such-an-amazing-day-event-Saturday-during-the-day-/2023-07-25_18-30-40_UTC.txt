Such an amazing day/event Saturday during the day at the iconic Sweet Juice Festival and I was happy to be there in support my friend Mel, one of the event organizers…It was “truly empowering community action and engagement through art, music and joyful connection,”…not to mention a darn good grilled mushroom burger!

@sweetjuicefest is a queer-artist-led collective whose mission is to inspire community action and engagement through immersive musical experiences, artistic expression, and joyful connection. With each event, we aim to inspire casual music-goers to get more deeply involved in their neighborhoods and strengthen the network of artists, individuals, and organizations working to vitalize their communities here in Philadelphia.

About the importance of community events: Recent shifts in the social environment of LGBT people in some regions of the world allow the experience of a more accepting and inclusive society. There are clear changes in the status and experiences of LGBT persons in society. Such changes require that minority stress, which highlights the importance of the social environment to understanding LGBT populations, be regularly reassessed and expanded to account for the shifting social context.
