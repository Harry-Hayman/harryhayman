It was one of those times in life when you stop and say, wow, this is really cool…and that was the case when my phone rang, and it was Dr. Dickson Despommier.  For those who are not familiar, Dr. Despommier is considered the father of the vertical farming movement and the author of The Vertical Farm. We spoke at length about how this all came to be, the state of the vertical farming industry, and how vertical farms can help our cities of the future.  We can’t thank Dickson enough for his time, insights, and generous offer to help as we pursue this for Philadelphia.⁣
Dickson Despommier is an Emeritus Professor of Public Health and Microbiology. At present, he is engaged in a project whose mission is to produce significant amounts of food crops in tall buildings situated in densely populated urban centers (see: www.verticalfarm.com and The Vertical Farm: feeding the world in the 21st century, Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin’s Press, New York, 2010; paperback, Picadore Pubs. 2011).⁣
The term “vertical farming” has not been around long. It refers to a method of growing crops, usually without soil or natural light, in beds stacked vertically inside a controlled-environment building. The credit for coining the term seems to belong to Dickson D. Despommier, Ph.D., a professor (now emeritus) of parasitology and environmental science at Columbia University Medical School and the author of “The Vertical Farm: Feeding the World in the 21st Century.”⁣
