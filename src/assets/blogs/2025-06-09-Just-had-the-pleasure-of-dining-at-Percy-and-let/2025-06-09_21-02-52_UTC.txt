Just had the pleasure of dining at Percy — and let me tell you, this place is so much more than just a restaurant

Nestled right on North Front Street, Percy is what happens when craftsmanship, culinary artistry, and hometown pride collide at full speed. Every inch of the space — the walls, the tables, the bar — is literally built by them, by hand, by heart.

And the food? Forget about it. Locally sourced, passionately plated, and damn near revolutionary. From the Hokkaido Scallop Crudo that tasted like the ocean itself whispered to the chefs — to the Roasted Half Chicken so perfectly tender it made the concept of “comfort food” blush — every dish is a love letter to what happens when you do it yourself and do it right.

Even the drinks are a master class — from classic pours to the wild genius of house-made infusions that taste like your favorite song.

In a world full of cookie-cutter concepts and prefab experiences, Percy is a cathedral of craft — a reminder that when you build it with your own two hands, magic happens.

Here’s to Percy — built by hand, fueled by soul, and unapologetically local.
