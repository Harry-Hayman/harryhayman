Ever been to church with an ocean view and ukulele music? 🌊🎶 I had an incredible experience in Hawaii at the North Shore Roman Catholic Community Church. The warmth, the welcome, the sense of connection—it reminded me that no matter where we are, people are people. One world, one love. 🌍❤️ #TravelStories #OneLove #Community
