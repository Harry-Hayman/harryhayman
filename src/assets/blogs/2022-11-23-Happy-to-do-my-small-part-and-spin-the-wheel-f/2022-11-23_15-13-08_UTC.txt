Happy to do my (small) part and "spin the wheel" for hunger for my friends at Philabundance, Kim, Loree, Kathy, Dorothy, and everyone else...keep up the good work! If you see Phiabudance out and about, take a moment to spin the wheel or even donate.⁣

Every $10 you donate today helps Philabundance provide enough food for up to 20 meals for our neighbors facing hunger. Thank you for your support.⁣

Philabundance serves our neighbors in need through a network of 350 partners, including churches, hospitals, schools, libraries, and other service providers. We can't fight hunger alone -- we need everyone to collaborate, including individuals, corporations, foundations, the government, and other hunger nonprofits.⁣
