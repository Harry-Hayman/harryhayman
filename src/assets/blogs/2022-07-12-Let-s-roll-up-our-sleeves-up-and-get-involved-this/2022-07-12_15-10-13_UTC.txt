Let’s roll up our sleeves up and get involved this summer.  Our ongoing mission is to provide excess food to The Less Fortunate.  Even if you don’t have the food, donate your time to volunteer for various organizations.  Want to help? Send me a message, and I will connect you to organizations that need a helping hand.
