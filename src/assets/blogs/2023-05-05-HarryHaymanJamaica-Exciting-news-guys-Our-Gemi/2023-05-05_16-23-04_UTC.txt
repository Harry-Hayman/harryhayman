#HarryHaymanJamaica? Exciting news, guys! Our Gemini consulting company has been approached for an amazing project. We're building a juice bar, healthy food store with a liquor license in Montego Bay, Jamaica!
We're heading there in a few weeks to check out the site and figure out the best way to use the space. Plus, it's right by the beach! I might even move there to oversee the project. Stay tuned for more updates. And if you need hospitality consultants, don't hesitate to reach out. We're happy to help in any way we can. Talk soon! Thanks. #GeminiHospitality #MontegoBay #JuiceBar #HealthyFood #HospitalityConsultants
