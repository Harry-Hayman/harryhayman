Do you have your CSA? I do...and it is so much more than a CSA...dare I say it is a movement...join the movement and click below and get your fresh, locally grown produce by a Black AND woman-led organization to boot! @farmerjawn_ 

 What is a CSA? Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), one type of direct marketing, consists of a community of individuals who pledge support to a farm operation so that the farmland becomes, either legally or spiritually, the community's farm, with the growers and consumers providing mutual support and sharing the risks and benefits of food production. 
 
Why You Should Choose FarmerJawn? "Choose FarmerJawn to grow your food– we're not just any farm. We are a Black AND woman led organization that is doing something that’s never been done with our 128 acres of land. We are growing food and educating the next BIPOC farmers of America and growing organic food for all because you deserve chemical free at a fair price!

We are deeply committed to the health of both people and the planet. When you choose us, you're part of a historic movement, transforming 'food is medicine' from a mere phrase to a practical reality.
