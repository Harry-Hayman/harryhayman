Pleased and honored to meet Dominic Vitiello to talk all things food economy and systems - an insightful conversation.  Reading his book now.⁣
 In The Sanctuary City, Domenic Vitiello argues that sanctuary means much more than the limited protections offered by city governments or churches sheltering immigrants from deportation. It is a wider set of protections and humanitarian support for vulnerable newcomers. Sanctuary cities are the places where immigrants and their allies create safe spaces to rebuild lives and communities, often through the work of social movements and community organizations or civil society.⁣
Philadelphia has been an important center of sanctuary and reflects the growing diversity of American cities in recent decades. ⁣
