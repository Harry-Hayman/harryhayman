Clínica de Migrantes. Really cool, heart-warming documentary on a good man whom I have the pleasure of knowing...please check it out and consider supporting...thank you. Now playing on HBO MAX⁣

Undocumented immigrants with medical issues often end up in ERs for care, a costly last resort in which patients can be charged thousands for little more than an aspirin. Filmmaker Maxim Pozdorovkin shines a well-deserved light on Puentes de Salud, a healthcare clinic serving a population that all-too-easily slips through the cracks.⁣
