This weekend, July 17-19, the Philadelphia Film Society is hosting the first ever Virtual SummerFest — and I’m happy I got my pass. The Virtual SummerFest includes a line-up of critically-acclaimed films to watch online, followed by a Q&A session. If anything, get the SummerFest pass to connect with filmmakers from around the world! #film #philly #filmfestival #acting #entertainment #philadelphia #summerfest #virtualsummerfest #filmmakers #festival #webinar #Philadelphiafilmsociety #weekendplans #instagood https://bit.ly/32hmX9N
