Last week I was honored to be invited to attend a “Conversation with the Governor” Josh Shapiro. I was very impressed with his candor on issues and his perspective, and I look forward to working with him on some of our initiatives at The Greater Philadelphia Economy League

“Conversation with the Governor” is an annual event that connects members of the regional business community with the Governor of Pennsylvania. Attendees get the chance to hear candid and engaging commentary via an informal interview with the Governor, who shares his vision for the Commonwealth and the Greater Philadelphia region.
Joshua David Shapiro is an American politician and attorney who has served as the 48th governor of Pennsylvania since 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 50th Pennsylvania attorney general from 2017 to 2023.
