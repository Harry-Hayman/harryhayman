Much love and appreciation to the Javits Center for giving us a “behind the scenes” look at their incredible convention center, sharing their insights on how to be diverse and equitable and all the nuances that went into opening (and expanding) the center and then…this…

 As far as the eye could see…green things! On the roof! Love it! “Our kitchen is right there; we walk out, pick the greens and then serve to our guests.” Fruits and vegetables, plants and leafy greens, and I asked why did you do this…” to do our part to be sustainable and achieve our carbon footprint goals”…wow, how cool is that? And good, healthy, nutritional value of the greens to boot.

 The Javits Center is more than just a convention center. Named after the legendary and lifelong New Yorker, Senator Jacob K. Javits, this self-sustaining New York icon has become a wildlife sanctuary, a community partner, and a nationwide nexus where the latest ideas in business and pop culture converge under one very green roof. 

Indoor vertical farming can be defined as the practice of growing produce stacked one above another in a closed and controlled environment. By using growing shelves mounted vertically, it significantly reduces the amount of land space needed to grow plants compared to traditional farming methods.

You may be asking yourself…where can controlled environmental agriculture be done? Is the answer…anywhere? Yes…it is! Can we do it Philly? Yes, we can…then why are we not? Hello.!!!!
