So Freekin’ dope…can I say Freekin’? I hope so..…any way, you must check out Rising Sun: Artists in Uncertain America if you have not already – great job Ashley!

It was a little hot walking down there but I got my steps in and really was blown away by the museum itself, the historical building and, of course, the amazing art and artists.

Rising Sun: Artists in an Uncertain America’ is an unprecedented partnership between AAMP and PAFA. The collaborative exhibition presents the work of 20 artists considering the question, “Is the sun rising or setting on the experiment of American democracy?” Most wanted to “wait-and-see.”
