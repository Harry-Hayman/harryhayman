As many know, we have a new Superintendent of The School District of Philadelphia, Tony B. Watlington Sr., Ed.D. Dr. Watlington will be hosting Listening & Learning Sessions during the transition process. It was an honor to have lunch with Dr. Watlington as part of his first 100 days of engagement. We are lucky to have Dr. Watlington.⁣
⁣
His First 100 Days: includes Listening and Learning about upcoming community engagement opportunities. Dr. Watlington will be meeting and hearing from the community. He will also provide updates on his progress on the website https://www.philasd.org/100days/#eo.
