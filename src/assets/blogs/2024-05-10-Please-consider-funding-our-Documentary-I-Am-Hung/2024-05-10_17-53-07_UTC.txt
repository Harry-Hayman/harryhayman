Please consider funding our Documentary “I Am Hungry: The Many Faces Of Food Insecurity”

We are dedicated to creating this documentary to bring out the truth of how and why 312,000 Philadelphians can’t afford to eat.

This is a serious problem that nobody is talking about, and the amount of those suffering is only growing faster.

We need to solve this problem. And We discuss the problem and the solutions in “I Am Hungry”
