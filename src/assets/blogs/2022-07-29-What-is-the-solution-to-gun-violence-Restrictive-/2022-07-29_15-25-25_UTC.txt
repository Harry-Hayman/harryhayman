What is the solution to gun violence? Restrictive gun policies, voting, mandatory ongoing anger management, better jobs, improve the economy… the list goes on and on. Individually, we may not have the power to implement the solutions; however, collectively, we can donate, volunteer, and support many organizations in the trenches fighting against gun violence. In conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce, I will be hosting a town hall soon…stay tuned for details. In addition, The Harry Hayman Helps Benevolence Fund is one of the ways my organization gives back. 
If you are interested in donating, send me a message.
