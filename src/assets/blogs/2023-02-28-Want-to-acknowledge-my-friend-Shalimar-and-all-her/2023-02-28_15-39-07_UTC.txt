Want to acknowledge my friend Shalimar and all her efforts in general on behalf of The North Broad Renaissance, on which I am on the advisory board and specifically for a recent gathering of a series of meeting with all the mayor candidates.  I got an opportunity to say hi to Jeff Brown and talk in-depth with Derek Green regarding how we can best feed the less fortunate going forward.  Also want to thank the Met for hosting.⁣
#NBR The North Broad Renaissance is a non-profit that serves as a Special Service District (SSD) whose primary role is to provide communication and information to City administrators and Council, neighborhood and community groups, and others who are (or may) do business or development or other activities on North Broad, from City Hall to Germantown Avenue.⁣
#DerekGreen Derek Green was an at-large council member since 2015. He was previously an assistant district attorney in the city and a federal prosecutor in Delaware. For over a decade, he was special counsel for former council member Marian Tasco.  In his campaign announcement, he said citizens must "expect more" from the city and "deserve better."⁣
#JeffBrown  Brown, who owns several Shop Rite stores in the Philadelphia area.  He has no government experience but said he's running to help improve the city and make it safer. "Jeff has a vision for helping to make Philadelphia safe and prosperous by supporting unions and small businesses while ensuring the city is providing the quality services Philadelphians need and deserve," the union said in a news release.⁣
#TheMetPhilly Located on North Broad Street, The Met Philadelphia, the former Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House, is now open. The historic theater is a crown jewel of North Broad Street’s renaissance – and you can be part of the action.⁣
