WE CAME. WE SIPPED. WE SAMPLE.  WE SAMPLED MORE.  WE ASCENDED. 

We pre-gamed Nubya Garcia’s soul-stretching set by dining at Local Wine & Kitchen in Ardmore—and let us tell you: this place does not miss.
From the first pour to the last bite, everything hit like a Miles Davis solo—bold, intentional, and unforgettable.

Clams? Spicy and Sublime.
Hokkaido Scallops with miso corn purée? Textural jazz.
Cheese & charcuterie board? A global passport for your palate.
Wine list? Curated by someone who clearly understands romance, risk, and umami.
And the Cocktails?  Carefully curated
Shoutout to the team at Local Wine & Kitchen for the kind of hospitality and flavor that made us feel like we were backstage at a gourmet jazz concert.

Whether you’re heading to a show or just need to feel something real, do yourself a favor and make a reservation.
