As you know, Iâ€™m working on projects to build indoor Agriculture. Energy is one of the top 3 operating expenses of indoor growing. Creating the optimal grow environment and identifying the ideal combination of lighting, heating, cooling, and humidity takes expertise in critical environments and agricultural know-how.

Join us for an insightful session with energy suppliers and growers as they share how to maximize your energy use and minimize expenses if you want to learn more about how it works. Indoor Ag-Conversations series brings you monthly programs covering the latest trends, innovations & best practices. A webinar series will help you find new ways to grow your business. The next one is on July 13, 2022, at 02:30 PM https://indoor.ag/webinar/
