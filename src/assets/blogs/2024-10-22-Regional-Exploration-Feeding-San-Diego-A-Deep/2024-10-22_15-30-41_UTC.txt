üöê Regional Exploration: Feeding San Diego - A Deep Dive into Food Insecurity üçé

Our GPLEX participants had the unique opportunity to explore the critical issue of food insecurity with Feeding San Diego, where we learned about the complex challenges faced by communities not just in San Diego, but across the nation.
A special THANK YOU to our incredible and gracious host, Clay Alexander, whose deep knowledge and passion illuminated the many layers of food insecurity. His insightful perspective sparked meaningful conversations as the group actively engaged with thought-provoking questions, all with the goal of better understanding and supporting those in need.

Together, we‚Äôre not just learning‚Äîwe‚Äôre looking for ways to make a difference.

Thank you, Clay (and all the GPEXers who attended this regional exploration), for your generosity and dedication to this important cause.
