Took a tour to the Navy Shipyard with the LAI Group – Lambda Alpha International. We joined with Mosaic Development Partners, which allowed me to traverse the navy yard and experience all its wonders first-hand. It’s crazy how many people have lived in this area for years but haven't had the chance to experience quite everything. The Philadelphia navy yard development is like a hidden gem, and it was so exciting to see all the amazing projects going on there. Who knows what else could be further down the 76 that we haven't explored yet - but I'm already looking forward to discovering more!
Mosaic Development Partners was selected as the co-developer of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, a 109-acre parcel on the Delaware waterfront. The project is expected to encompass 5 million sf of mixed-use development, including housing, biosciences, office, retail, and hospitality
Lambda Alpha International, the Honorary Society for the Advancement of Land Economics, was founded in 1930 under the leadership of the renowned land economist and champion of academic freedom, Richard T. Ely. As an honorary society, it provides a forum for the study and advancement of land economics where the “winnowing and sifting” of ideas takes place in an atmosphere of mutual respect.
