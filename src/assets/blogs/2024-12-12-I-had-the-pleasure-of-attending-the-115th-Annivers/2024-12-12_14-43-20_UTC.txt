I had the pleasure of attending the 115th Anniversary 'Anti-Gala' hosted by the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia—a celebration of impact, connection, and growth. From incredible honorees to inspiring conversations, it was truly a moment to reflect on how we can build a stronger, more inclusive community. 🌟

A big shoutout to the sponsors and the talented local food and drink vendors who made the evening extra special! 🙌🍽️
