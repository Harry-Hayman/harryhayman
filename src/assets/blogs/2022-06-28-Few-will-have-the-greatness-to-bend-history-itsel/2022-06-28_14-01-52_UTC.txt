"Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation."-Bobby Kennedy⁣
Taking action and being a part of change is challenging, but if we all collectively do something as part of history. We are involved in various projects from Feed Philly, Philabundance to Alex’s Lemonade; it takes one daring move to volunteer, donate, or share the message. I’m inviting you to take action; what the action is will be up to you.  Your participation is needed, and we would love to have you.
