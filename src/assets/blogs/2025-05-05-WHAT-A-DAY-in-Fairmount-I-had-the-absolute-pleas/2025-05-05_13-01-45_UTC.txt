WHAT A DAY in Fairmount!

I had the absolute pleasure of checking out the Fairmount Arts Crawl — and it was very cool, what an explosion of creativity, color, and community spirit!

Everywhere you turned — restaurants, cafes, shops, even bars — were bursting with incredible local art, live music, family fun, and that unbeatable only-in-Philly energy. 

Seeing Fairmount transform into a living, breathing art gallery was nothing short of inspiring. Huge shoutout to the Park to Broad District for making magic happen - so many times I just walk (or drive) by without having any idea what is going on inside!

If you missed it, you missed out — but trust me, the creative heartbeat of Philly is alive and thriving - it's okay to stop by anytime!

Let’s keep supporting our local artists, businesses, and dreamers — events like this show what’s possible when a community comes together! #SupportLocal #FairmountArtsCrawl #ParkToBroad #PhillyArts #CityOfCreators
