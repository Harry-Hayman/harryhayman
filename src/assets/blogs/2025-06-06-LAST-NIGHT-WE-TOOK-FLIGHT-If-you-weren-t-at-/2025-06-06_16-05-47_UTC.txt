LAST NIGHT... WE TOOK FLIGHT. 

If you weren’t at SOUTH for the Zawinul Legacy Band 3.0 tribute to Weather Report, where were you really?

We weren’t just listening — we were levitating on pure musical genius. 

A swirling, explosive homage to the one and only Joe Zawinul — the architect who redefined jazz, tore down genre walls, and rewired the very DNA of music. From “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” to the immortal “Birdland,” Zawinul didn’t just play notes — he summoned worlds.

And let’s talk Weather Report: A band so far ahead of its time it made the future feel outdated. Wayne Shorter’s soaring sax. Jaco Pastorius’ thunderous bass. Zawinul’s galactic synths. They didn’t just invent world fusion — they bent it to their will.

The Zawinul Legacy Band 3.0 isn’t here for nostalgia — they are breathing new fire into a sound that changed everything. The groove, the audacity, the wild, cosmic alchemy — it’s all here, alive and electric. ⚡

Missed last night? Don’t make the same mistake twice.

Tonight — TWO MORE SHOWS!
7:00 PM
9:30 PM
SOUTH Jazz Club, where the spirit of Weather Report isn’t just honored — it’s unleashed.

Come. Witness. Ascend.
