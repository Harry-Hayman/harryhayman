Have you ever seen Jazz live? 🎺🥁

You really should!

there are many jazz clubs across the country,

with @southjazzkitchen in Philadelphia being one of the best! 

So celebrate Jazz Appreciation Month this April and support the Jazz community by visiting a live show.

You won’t regret it, thank you.
