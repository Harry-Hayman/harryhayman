This Weekend at SOUTH Was…Packed. Electric. Unforgettable.
Another sold-out, soul-shaking, joy-drenched weekend at the best damn jazz club and restaurant in the city. Yes — SOUTH.

And who lit the whole room on fire?
Alphonso Horne & the Gotham Kings — blowing the roof off the joint like New Orleans royalty dropped into Broad Street.

Swagger. Style. Soul.

The kind of set that grabs your heart, rattles your bones, and reminds you why music matters.
This wasn’t a concert — this was a spiritual experience with a swing.
And while they baptized the stage in brass, there was New Sothern Cuisine from Charlestown, Cocktails to die for and service so good it should win Grammys.

SOUTH isn’t just the best jazz club in Philly —it’s one of the best restaurants, period.

A whole damn vibe. A hidden-in-plain-sight treasure.
If you don't knooooowwwwwwww....now you know...

🎷 Thank you Alphonso Horne & the Gotham Kings — y’all showed UP.
