Such a pleasure and honor to host my friend Sam Katz at a GPLEX 360 live-viewing of a documentary screening about the Detroit bankruptcy called "Gradually, then Suddenly," followed by an interview and Q&A with the director. 
 
Special Thanks to Daniel DeJesus and Bill Rhoads from Esperanza (https://esperanzahealth.com/) for hosting up and Miss. Santiago from Freddy & Tony's for providing the food.
