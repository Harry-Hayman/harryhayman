I am hoping this coffee meeting was one of those “dots” that Steve Jobs was talking about at his Stanford Commencement Speech – sure felt like it!

I had the pleasure and honor of meeting with Ed Barret from a little company called Freight Farms which just so happens to be the world’s largest supplier of freight farms – so cool, and we are talking about introducing freight farms to community gardens throughout Philadelphia.

…And, of course, we met at the coolest little coffee shop in Philly…Coffee Cream and Dreams…and Ed and I are getting back together to “dream” some more –the best way to predict the future is to create it, right? (or something like that)…

The mission of Freight Farms is to create a global infrastructure to revolutionize local access to food. At Freight Farms, we believe that healthy food is a right, not a luxury. For this reason, we are dedicated to making fresh food accessible to anyone, anywhere, any time, with a complete platform of products and services — the Greenery™ S, farmhand®, and Client Services — to empower our global community of partners.
