Hard to believe we are just 17 days away from GPLEX 2023! GPLEX 2023 is set to be one of Philadelphia's most dynamic events for cross-sector networking and collaboration. I am joining over 200 other leaders from the Philadelphia area who are gearing up for a transformative 3-day leadership exchange in the vibrant city of New Orleans. @economyleague

As we approach this exciting event, I would like to take a moment to reflect on my experience at GPLEX 2022 in Detroit. It was inspiring to see such a collaborative effort between the private sector, philanthropy, government and NGOâ€™s working together seamlessly to impart real change.

Stay tuned for more updates and insights as we count down to GPLEX 2023 in the Big Easy!
