Introducing the Break the Ice Dinner Series: community-wide events to support mental health in our Food & Beverage community. We know it isn’t easy to talk about mental health. We want to make it easier. These dinners will be a chance to support spots that care about mental health, while helping to grow our Community Fund to support food service workers.⁣
We will be donating 10% of sales back to Cooks who Care to support mental health!  Check out Cooks who Care to Learn more! https://www.instagram.com/cookswhocare/ https://cookswhocare.org/⁣
