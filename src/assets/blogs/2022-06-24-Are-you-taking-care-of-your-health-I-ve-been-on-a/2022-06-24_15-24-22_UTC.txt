Are you taking care of your health? I’ve been on a health journey on a mission to improve my health. I’m the grandson of a veteran who served in WWII and the nephew of two uncles who served in Vietnam. I’ve seen firsthand the results of veterans who come home needing assistance with taking care of their health, finances, housing, and more. Our goal at 98 Octane is to help 1 Million veterans live a happier, healthier life. We always seek support, ideas, and resources to continue our mission. Let me know if you want to get involved.
