Such a great night of music Sunday @southjazzkitchen with Ryan Gilfilian hosted by Michael Tozzi 

@ryangilfillian is a Philadelphia-based singer/songwriter that is providing soulful therapy for all that have dealt with the pain of heartbreak. 

The warmth of Ryan’s tone carries you into a safe place of vulnerability and self-reflection as you think back on the good and the bad of past relationships.

About Michael Tozzi's First Sunday Jazz Series: Michael Tozzi, creator of the “First Sunday Emerging Artist Series,” is off to a great start at South Jazz Kitchen in Philadelphia. 

“The series was born out of the frustration of so many artists that feel that they don’t have a chance to move forward in the music business because no one will give them the opportunity to play venues where they can get noticed,” Tozzi said. @jjz_philadelphia
Tozzi, a longtime radio entrepreneur who has also volunteered as emcee at the Jazz Philadelphia Summit, says he saw a need for exposing audiences to new talent. @jazzphiladelphia

Jazz music is an incredibly important part of American culture. There is a rich jazz history that has had a ripple effect on nearly every aspect of American life from style and social movements to the music that came after. The women’s liberation movement was a huge cultural moment, thanks in part to the influence of jazz.
