Always great to see the friends of my youth and support a great cause. “I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, does anyone?”⁣

Stand By Me’s (1986) final line, delivered by Richard Dreyfuss and his green-text computer, is a perfect encapsulation of the film’s entire message. It is a quote that defines coming of age and captures the essence of childhood friendships, as well as the way children are naive to their significance during youth. There’s a reality behind that statement that doesn’t just relate to the themes of the film, but themes of life. The friendships and associations we make as children are never the same as the ones we make as adults.⁣

@GreatChefsEvent Together, more than 750 guests and 40 chefs and drink vendors raised over $430,000 to fund critical childhood cancer research grants that will lead to safer treatments and more cures! It was wonderful to share an appetite for helping kids with cancer during this delectable event.⁣

The afternoon was filled with great food, great atmosphere, and great company. Alongside all our outstanding supporters was childhood cancer hero Karina and her mom, Jessica, who shared the moving story about her daughter’s battle with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.⁣
