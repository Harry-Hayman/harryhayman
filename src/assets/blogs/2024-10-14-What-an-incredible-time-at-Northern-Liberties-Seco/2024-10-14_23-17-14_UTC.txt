What an incredible time at Northern Liberties Second Saturday: Celebrating Indigenous Foodways!  It was so much more than just a farmer's marketâ€”this event brought the community together in a special way to honor indigenous food traditions and celebrate local food systems.

From the music by DJ Mighty Flipside, to kid-friendly yoga with Tula Yoga, and Stacey Woodsonâ€™s inspiring storytime, it was a day filled with meaningful connections and activities for all ages. I especially loved seeing the tortilla-making and tastings with Masa Cooperativeâ€”such a delicious and educational experience that showcased the richness of indigenous foodways.

Itâ€™s events like these that are so vital to the growth and health of our local food economy. Farmersâ€™ markets are essential, not just for access to fresh, nutritious food, but also for supporting our local farmers, artisans, and small businesses. We need more people to come out, join in, and support these incredible initiatives!

As we gear up for Indigenous Peopleâ€™s Day coming up, letâ€™s remember the importance of honoring and preserving the food traditions that have sustained communities for generations. Letâ€™s keep building these connections and ensuring that our local food systems thrive! ðŸ«¶ #SupportLocal #FarmersMarket #IndigenousPeoplesDay #PhillyFoodEconomy
