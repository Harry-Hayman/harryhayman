The Mayor’s Office of Public Engagement, with creative direction from the Mayor’s Office of Black Male Engagement (OBME), is on a mission to amplify the stories of redemption, reconciliation, and restoration taking place across the city to end gun violence.

A Hope That Lights The Way is both a community-based engagement process and a documentary project that unveils and uplifts the impactful stories of individuals who have successfully overcome the daunting challenges posed by gun violence.
