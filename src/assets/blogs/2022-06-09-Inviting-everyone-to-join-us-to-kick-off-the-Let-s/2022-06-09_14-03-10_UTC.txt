When the school year ends in June, kids lose access to free school breakfast and lunch programs. Without these programs, kids often need help to access fresh and nutritious foods over the summer.⁣
⁣
Let's Eat is a program to ensure that thousands of children will have access to fresh, healthy meals that families can prepare.⁣
⁣
Starting June 13th, we will distribute 2,000 meal kits per week for eight weeks, each providing eight meals (4 servings per dish).
