The Economy League of Greater Philadelphia is launching the latest version of the Well City Challenge! On Saturday, January 21, 12 pm- 4pm, meet us at The Franklin Institute as we kick off the Well City Challenge with the Call for Ideas!⁣
Very excited to be one of the hosts of the breakout session for food and food-related ideas for this event... an awesome, incredibly impactful initiative, so spread the word to your network about it. Thank you.⁣
We will be soliciting proposals from the community and supporting their development through workshops, pitch competitions, mentorship, an accelerator, over $100,000 in prizes, and access to seed investments.⁣
