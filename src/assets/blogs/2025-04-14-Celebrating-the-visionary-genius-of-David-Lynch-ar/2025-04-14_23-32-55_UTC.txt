Celebrating the visionary genius of David Lynch—artist, filmmaker, and master of the surreal. His time in Philly’s Eraserhood left an indelible mark on his imagination, birthing the nightmarish beauty of Eraserhead and setting the tone for a lifetime of dreamlike storytelling. Here’s to the man who turned shadowy streets into portals of wonder and unease. Join us in honoring his life and work at this year’s Eraserhood Fest.
