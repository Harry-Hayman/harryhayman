THE EVENT WAS ALREADY LEGENDARY. 

What happens when you mix revolutionary ideas, community brilliance, and unapologetic Black excellence? You get the official launch of the Fair City Challenge — and Philly showed up.
Dr. Andre Perry dropped knowledge so powerful it could rezone the city. His new book Black Power Scorecard is required reading for anyone serious about equity and valuation justice.

Big love to Sara Lomax-Reese and WURD Radio for broadcasting LIVE from the scene — amplifying voices that matter.

Huge thanks to P4 Hub for opening their doors and their hearts to this movement.

Major Flavor Catering came through with the heat — feeding minds AND stomachs.

Shoutout to Uncle Bobbie’s for making sure the people had the literature to match the moment.

...And of course, nothing but gratitude to the Economy League — leading the charge in turning bold ideas into real systems change w/ support from TD Bank.........

This wasn’t just an event — it was a movement milestone.

If you missed it, don’t worry. This is just the beginning.
