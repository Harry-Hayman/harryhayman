PAGE: Equitable & Inclusive Growth in Action

Honored to play a small part in the impactful work of PAGE, our region's anchor collaborative. In partnership with the Economy League, the City of Philadelphia, and numerous regional institutions, PAGE is committed to localizing and diversifying supply chains. Through intentionality and mutual accountability, we're working towards local economic growth and closing equity gaps. #PAGEimpact #InclusiveGrowth

Nimble and Iterative Approach

One of PAGE's greatest strengths lies in its nimble and iterative approach. Working directly with procurement professionals and local business owners, we understand real-time challenges and have introduced innovations like the Hurdle Fund, providing rapid grants for firms in need. #Innovation #PAGEinnovates
