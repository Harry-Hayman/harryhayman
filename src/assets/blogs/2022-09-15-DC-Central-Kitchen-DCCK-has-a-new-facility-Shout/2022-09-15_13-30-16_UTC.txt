DC Central Kitchen #DCCK has a new facility. Shout out to DCCK and all their hard work (congrats on the new digs!), and I look forward to visiting soon!⁣

DC Central Kitchen (DCCK) is a Washington, DC-based direct service nonprofit whose mission is to use food as a tool to strengthen bodies, empower minds, and build communities.⁣
⁣
In the fall of 2022, DCCK will transition from an overcrowded basement to its new facility—a state-of-the-art commercial kitchen, staff headquarters, and community hub in the Buzzard Point neighborhood of Southwest Washington, DC.⁣
