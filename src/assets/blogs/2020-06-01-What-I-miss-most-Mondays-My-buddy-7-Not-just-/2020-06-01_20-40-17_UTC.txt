What I miss most Mondays! – My buddy, 7! Not just since #Quarantine — we lost 7 before that — but I have been rocking the couch a lot lately because of this #Covid19 BS and I miss him! I remember I’d always get in position first, and once he’d see me, he’d jump up on the lower end of the couch, make his way over, give me a quick lick on the face, then nestle his butt between me and the couch. After that, he’d rest his head on my chest. We would be there for as long as we could be. Some Sundays, we would be there from the 1PM game until the last game of the night! Maybe a quick trip to the bathroom, and then, right back in position! #7 #mansbestfriend #dogs #RIP #dogsofinstagram #pets #dogsarefamily #animallove #mondays
