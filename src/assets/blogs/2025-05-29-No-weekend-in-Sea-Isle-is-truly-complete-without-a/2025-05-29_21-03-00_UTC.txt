No weekend in Sea Isle is truly complete without a mandatory pilgrimage to Mike’s Seafood — because let’s be honest, it’s not just a meal… it’s a shoreline rite of passage.

You roll up sun-kissed, half-sandy, and 100% hungry — and then boom:
The shrimp’s still snapping.
The lobster roll is borderline criminal.
The crab cakes? Straight from Poseidon’s personal stash.
And the fried combo platter? Don’t even think about splitting it.

Mike’s isn’t fancy — it’s real, it’s fresh, and it’s been feeding generations of beachgoers, fishermen, and seafood junkies who know that THIS is what summer tastes like.

- Dockside dining
- Old-school Jersey seafood vibes
- Family-owned and legendary for a reason

So here’s the rule:
Hit the beach, rinse the sand off your feet, and head to Mike’s.
No excuses. No substitutions. No regrets.

Sea Isle City, NJ
Pro tip: get there early or be ready to wait — and it’s worth every second.
