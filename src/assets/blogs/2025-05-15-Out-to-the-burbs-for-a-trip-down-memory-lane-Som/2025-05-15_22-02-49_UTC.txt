Out to the 'burbs for a trip down memory lane

Sometimes you’ve got to head back to where you grew up —to recharge, reflect, and remind yourself of the journey.
First stop: Radnor High School Baseball. Watching the next generation hustle under the same sun I once did? That’s a full-circle moment. The crack of the bat, the smell of fresh-cut grass—pure Americana.

Next up: A pilgrimage to John’s Hoagie Shop—because no trip home is complete without the hoagie. The kind that ruins you for all others. Sharp prov, vinegar drizzle, seeded roll... if you know, you know.

Then: Swung by for a quiet moment at St. Martin’s Church. The same pews, the same peace. Whether you’re religious or not, there's something sacred about a place that’s held your secrets, your hopes, your prayers.

Finally: Eastern University. Just me, a good book, and the pond. No meetings. No noise. Just stillness and reflection. The way the light dances on that water? That’s God winking.

From baseball to hoagies to holy spaces and still waters—this day was a love letter to my roots. Sometimes going back is how we move forward.
