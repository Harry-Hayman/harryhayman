Support a Local, Fair, and Just Food Economy!

As the Sr. Fellow to Food Economy & Policy at the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia, I am passionate about localizing our food economy. 

It’s essential for us to do everything we can to support our local farmers, producers, and food businesses.

This weekend, I had the privilege of stopping by the Philly Food Works Open House. This incredible event showcased the vibrant and diverse local food community we have right here in Philadelphia. 

It was inspiring to see so many dedicated individuals working together to create a fair, equitable, and sustainable food system.

Why Localize the Food Economy?

Sustainability: Reducing food miles and supporting environmentally friendly farming practices.

Community: Strengthening local businesses and creating jobs within our neighborhoods.

Health: Providing access to fresh, nutritious, and diverse food options.

Equity: Ensuring fair wages and working conditions for all food system workers.

Let’s come together to support our local food economy! 

By choosing local, we can build a more sustainable, equitable, and just future for all.
