Great to see my old friend Pierre Robert at Preston & Steve's "Campout for Hunger" - special acknowledgment to Acme for all they did and for providing my box of food!⁣
Radio Hall of Fame morning personalities Preston and Steve camped out and broadcast live outside of Xfinity Live!, located within the Wells Fargo Center Complex in South Philadelphia, in an effort to collect food and monetary donations from listeners and businesses throughout the tri-state area.⁣
Beasley Media Group’s 93.3 WMMR-FM proudly announces that the 25th Annual Preston & Steve Camp Out For Hunger event raised over 2.8 million pounds of food and over 1 million dollars in cash to benefit needy individuals and families residing throughout the greater Philadelphia area. Proceeds will directly benefit local hunger relief organizations through Philabundance.⁣
