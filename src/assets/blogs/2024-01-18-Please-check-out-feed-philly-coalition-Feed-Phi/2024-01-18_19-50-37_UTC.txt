Feed Philly Coalition is one of my biggest focuses right now. We work on food rescue initiatives, community-driven support systems, and applying innovative technologies to growing systems as well as education efforts. 

We have huge goals but these goals are made to simply help people, and give those long-term food security who are missing that basic need.
