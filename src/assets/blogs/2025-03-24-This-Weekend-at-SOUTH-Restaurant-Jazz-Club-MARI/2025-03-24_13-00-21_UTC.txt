This Weekend at SOUTH Restaurant & Jazz Club‚Ä¶ MARIANNE SOLIVAN LEFT US BREATHLESS.
With a voice like velvet and thunder, Marianne lit up the room with every note‚Äîsoulful, bold, and impossibly smooth. From the very first song, it was clear: we weren‚Äôt just watching a jazz vocalist‚Ä¶ we were witnessing a masterclass in musical storytelling.

The crowd? Spellbound.
The band? Tight.
The vibe? Pure magic.

She served up classic elegance with modern fire, bending every phrase to her will like a jazz sorceress. The kind of performance that lingers in your chest, long after the last note fades.

üç∏ The drinks were flowing.
üçΩÔ∏è The food was on point.
üé∂ And the music? Unforgettable.

If you missed it‚Ä¶ all we can say is: next time, don‚Äôt sleep. Marianne Solivan reminded us why SOUTH is the place for real jazz lovers and there is another great show coming up this weekend...and next...and the weekend after that...and that.
