Who cares about helping the less fortunate?

I care. You wonâ€™t believe the number of Philadelphia citizens who are suffering in silence. 

With the cost of food rising each year as fast as it is, some of our people are getting left behind.

That is why I am working on:
I Am Hungry: The Many Faces of Food Insecurity 

A documentary that will bring this silent epidemic in our city to the eyes of those who are unaware.

I encourage you to learn more about the food insecurity problem in Philadelphia by following
