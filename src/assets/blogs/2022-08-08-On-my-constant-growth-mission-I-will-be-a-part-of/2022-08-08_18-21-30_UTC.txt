On my constant growth mission, I will be a part of GPLEX and headed to Detroit to connect with other social impact professionals and organizations.⁣
⁣
Detroit is leading in the urban agriculture area, and I'm looking forward to connecting to leadership and seeing what's possible in the future.⁣

The GPLEX was born out of the desire to create a home for ongoing cohort connections and experiences. It's a once-a-year meeting of the minds that only taps into a small amount of the potential for this program, so 360 seeks to extend the mission and best parts of the conference for our community. Now we can connect almost every month to learn, question, and be curious as a group of influential change-makers.⁣
⁣
Looking to make sure Philadelphia has all the advantages and can grow from learning more from Detroit.⁣
