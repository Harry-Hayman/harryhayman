Pulled off the road and into what felt like a postcard — Bertuzzi’s Farm Market, where the air smells like fresh produce and warm nostalgia.

Tucked into the heart of New Jersey farm country, Bertuzzi’s isn’t just a roadside stop — it’s a family-run altar to all things fresh, local, and impossibly delicious. And yes, I did what any self-respecting traveler should do:
I walked out with a Dutch Caramel Walnut Apple Pie so good it made time stop.

Buttery crust.
Spiced apples that taste like fall got a second wind.
Caramel and walnut like a sweet, sticky love letter to your taste buds.

This isn’t dessert. This is farmstand magic.
The kind of pie that makes you text someone mid-bite.
The kind of place that reminds you why Jersey is the Garden State.

So here’s your sign: next time you’re anywhere near it, pull over. walk in. buy the pie. Trust me.
