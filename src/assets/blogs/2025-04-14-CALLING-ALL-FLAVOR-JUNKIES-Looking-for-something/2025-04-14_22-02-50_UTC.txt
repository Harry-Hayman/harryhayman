CALLING ALL FLAVOR JUNKIES 

Looking for something very creative in the culinary space?
That’s Black Dragon Take-Out.

✨ Black-owned. Local. Legendary. ✨

🥢 Spring Rolls – Crispier than your ex’s excuses. Flavor so deep it deserves its own podcast.

🥬 Cabbage – Sautéed to silk. Spiced just right. This is main character cabbage.

🍠 Sweet Potato Donuts – Soft. Sweet. Savory. A warm hug in donut form. Dessert? Breakfast? Late-night spiritual experience? ✅

And that’s just the beginning...

🔥 Everything on the menu SLAPS.
This ain’t just take-out — it’s a flavor sermon with no damn notes.

📍 Pull up. Order in. Get your life right.
📸 Tag us when you post that food — we’ll be the ones drooling in the comments.
