I want to acknowledge, congratulate and welcome Ms. Harris to PIDC - I look forward to working her on a number of projects that are coming down the pike.⁣
 The PIDC Board of Directors announced today that, after a robust regional and national search, Jodie Harris—an industry leader with three decades of experience spanning the public, private, and nonprofit sectors—has been selected to become the next president of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC). PIDC is Philadelphia’s official economic development corporation, founded by the City and Chamber of Commerce 65 years ago with the mission to spur investment, support business growth, and foster developments that create jobs, revitalize neighborhoodS, and drive inclusive growth to every corner of Philadelphia.⁣
