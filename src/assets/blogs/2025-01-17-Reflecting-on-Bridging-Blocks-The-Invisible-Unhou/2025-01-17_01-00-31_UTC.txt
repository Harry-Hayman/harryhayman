Reflecting on Bridging Blocks: The Invisible Unhoused 

I was truly honored to attend WHYY’s Bridging Blocks: The Invisible Unhoused event at the Parkway Central Library. Thank you to Eric Marsh and the entire WHYY team for spearheading such a vital conversation, and a heartfelt thank you to the Free Library of Philadelphia for hosting this meaningful gathering.

The event was a powerful reminder that addressing homelessness in Philadelphia requires collective action, empathy, and determination. Together, we can create real solutions and ensure no one in our city is left behind.

Let’s keep the conversation alive and continue working toward a Philadelphia where everyone has a safe place to call home.
