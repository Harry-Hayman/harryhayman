I wanted to welcome a new friend to the SOUTH family as we recently welcomed the young and talented Victory Boyd for three nights in March. We spent AN EVENING WITH VICTORY BOYD listening to Victory’ Boyd's music which is a fusion between Soul music and Folk Music.⁣
If you are not familiar:  Victory brings an entirely new youthful element to the music world, an indescribable spiritual depth mixed with her youthful interpretation of sound influencing her artistic expressions. Moreover, Victory colors a lot of her musical arrangements with rich jazz chords as she is rooted and grounded in the Jazz tradition.⁣
Ms. Boyd also has a new CD coming out…check it out, order it, and we are looking to bring her back soon…stay tuned!⁣
