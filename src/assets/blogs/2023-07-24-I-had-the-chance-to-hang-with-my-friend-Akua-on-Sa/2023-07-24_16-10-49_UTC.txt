I had the chance to hang with my friend Akua on Saturday night as she and her band, Akua Allrich & The Tribe, were doing their thing at the legendary @southjazzkitchen SOUTH RESTAURANT & JAZZ CLUB. Akua is amazing and such a joy to work with her style is fluid and ever evolving. Her musical roots run deeply into blues, soul, and R&B with clear grounding in jazz and pan-African music

@akuaallrich Jazz vocalist and DC-native Akua Allrich has proven herself to be a musician of extraordinary talent and crowd-moving passion. With finesse and charisma, this vocalist, composer, and teacher has successfully etched out a place for her unique musical expression, electrifying audiences in and around the nationâ€™s capital with sold-out performances.

Pan-Africanism is a worldwide movement that aims to encourage and strengthen bonds of solidarity between all indigenous and diasporas of African ancestry. Based on a common goal dating back to the Atlantic slave trade, the movement extends beyond continental Africans with a substantial support base among the African diaspora in the Americas and Europe.
