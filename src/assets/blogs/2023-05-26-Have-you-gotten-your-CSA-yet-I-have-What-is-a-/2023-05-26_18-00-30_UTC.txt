❓What is a CSA, you ask? Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), one type of direct marketing, consists of a community of individuals who pledge support to a farm operation so that the farmland becomes, either legally or spiritually, the community's farm, with the growers and consumers providing mutual support and sharing the risks and benefits of food production.
❓Why are CSAs important? CSAs give consumers a chance to eat seasonally, closing the gap between farm and plate, but there are many more benefits for both producers and consumers to participate in a CSA.

Consumers experience many benefits when choosing to subscribe to a local CSA:
High quality, fresh, nutritious food: CSA produce is often harvested within days or hours of delivery, meaning produce retains more nutritional value and stays fresher longer
