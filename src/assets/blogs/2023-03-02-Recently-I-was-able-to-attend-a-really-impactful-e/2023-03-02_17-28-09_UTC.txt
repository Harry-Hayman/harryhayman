Recently I was able to attend a really impactful event hosted by my friend Ken Anderson who did a great job leading the impressive panel on an exploration of some very pivotal topics. Kenneth Anderson is Vice President, Civic Affairs for The Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia.⁣

One of the topics of discussions was Improving Social Determinants of Health.  The conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, along with the broader set of forces and systems, greatly impact population health outcomes.  For more info https://chamberphl.com/⁣
