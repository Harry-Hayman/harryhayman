Looking forward to welcoming back my friend Alphonso and his band, The Gotham Kings, this Weekend @ SOUTH.  Alphonso Horne is one of the most sought-after musicians today. Known for his high level of musicianship.⁣
Gotham Kings is a high-energy immersive jazz experience! Two-time Grammy nominated trumpeter Alphonso Horne has put together a band that weaves the sound of New Orleans into a rich musical fabric that demonstrates the history of the trumpet and the story of jazz. Inspired by the music of King Oliver Creole Jazz Band.⁣
 King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band was one of the best and most important bands in early Jazz. The Creole Jazz Band was made up of the cream of New Orleans Hot Jazz musicians, featuring Baby Dodds on drums, Honore Dutrey on trombone, Bill Johnson on bass, Louis Armstrong on second cornet, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Lil Hardin-Armstrong on piano, and the band’s leader, King Oliver on cornet.⁣
